				<h2>Why Vagrant Changes Everything</h2>
				<p><strong>Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, maximizes <a href="http://www.12factor.net/dev-prod-parity">dev/prod parity</a>, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.</strong></p>

				<p>Developers no longer need to worry about setting up complicated infrastructure components. Projects with conflicting dependencies can each get their own sandbox -- keeping a developer's workstation free of the hacks needed for multiple versions of software to coexist.</p>

				<p>Operations engineers no longer need to worry about developers having a different local setup from production.  They can experiment and test their configuration management changes before going live.</p>
