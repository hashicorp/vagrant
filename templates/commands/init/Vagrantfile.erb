  # Boot with a GUI so you can see the screen. (Default is headless)

  # Assign this VM to a host only network IP, allowing you to access it
  # via the IP.
  # config.vm.network "33.33.33.10"

  # Forward a port from the guest to the host, which allows for outside
  # computers to access the VM, whereas host only networking does not.
  # config.vm.forward_port "http", 80, 8080

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # an identifier, the second is the path on the guest to mount the
  # folder, and the third is the path on the host to the actual folder.
  # config.vm.share_folder "v-data", "/vagrant_data", "../data")

  # Enable provisioning with chef solo, specifying a cookbooks path (relative
  # to this Vagrantfile), and adding some recipes and/or roles.

  # You may also specify custom JSON attributes:
  # config.chef.json = { :mysql_password => "foo" }

  # Enable provisioning with chef server, specifying the chef server URL,
  # and the path to the validation key (relative to this Vagrantfile).
  #
  # The Opscode Platform uses HTTPS. Substitute your organization for
  # ORGNAME in the URL and validation key.
  #
  # If you have your own Chef Server, use the appropriate URL, which may be
  # HTTP instead of HTTPS depending on your configuration. Also change the
  # validation key to validation.pem.
  #
  # config.vm.provisioner = :chef_server
  # config.chef.chef_server_url = "https://api.opscode.com/organizations/ORGNAME"
  # config.chef.validation_key_path = "ORGNAME-validator.pem"
  #
  # If you're using the Opscode platform, your validator client is
  # ORGNAME-validator, replacing ORGNAME with your organization name.
  #
  # IF you have your own Chef Server, the default validation client name is
  # chef-validator, unless you changed the configuration.
  #
  # config.chef.validation_client_name = "ORGNAME-validator"
