  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  # config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Don't boot with headless mode
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
  #   vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  # end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Enable provisioning with CFEngine. CFEngine Community packages are
  # automatically installed. For example, configure the host as a
  # policy server and optionally a policy file to run:
  #
  # config.vm.provision "cfengine" do |cf|
  #   cf.am_policy_hub = true
  #   # cf.run_file = "motd.cf"
  # end
  #
  # You can also configure and bootstrap a client to an existing
  # policy server:
  #
  # config.vm.provision "cfengine" do |cf|
  #   cf.policy_server_address = "10.0.2.15"
  # end

  # Enable provisioning with Puppet stand alone.  Puppet manifests
  # are contained in a directory path relative to this Vagrantfile.
  # You will need to create the manifests directory and a manifest in
  # the file default.pp in the manifests_path directory.
  #
  # config.vm.provision "puppet" do |puppet|
  #   puppet.manifests_path = "manifests"
  #   puppet.manifest_file  = "default.pp"
  # end

  # Enable provisioning with Chef Solo, specifying a cookbooks path, roles
  # path, and data_bags path (all relative to this Vagrantfile), and adding
  # some recipes and/or roles.
  #
  # config.vm.provision "chef_solo" do |chef|
  #   chef.cookbooks_path = "~/chef/cookbooks"
  #   chef.roles_path     = "~/chef/roles"
  #   chef.data_bags_path = "~/chef/data_bags"
  #
  #   chef.add_recipe "mysql"
  #   chef.add_role "web"
  #
  #   chef.json = { mysql_password: "foo" }
  # end
  #
  # Chef Solo will automatically install the latest version of Chef for you.
  # This can be configured in the provisioner block:
  #
  # config.vm.provision "chef_solo" do |chef|
  #   chef.version = "11.16.4"
  # end
  #
  # Alternative you can disable the installation of Chef entirely:
  #
  # config.vm.provision "chef_solo" do |chef|
  #   chef.install = false
  # end

  # Enable provisioning with Chef Zero. The Chef Zero provisioner accepts the
  # exact same parameter as the Chef Solo provisioner:
  #
  # config.vm.provision "chef_zero" do |chef|
  #   chef.cookbooks_path = "~/chef/cookbooks"
  #   chef.roles_path     = "~/chef/roles"
  #   chef.data_bags_path = "~/chef/data_bags"
  #
  #   chef.add_recipe "mysql"
  #   chef.add_role "web"
  #
  #   # You may also specify custom JSON attributes:
  #   chef.json = { mysql_password: "foo" }
  # end

  # Enable provisioning with Chef Server, specifying the chef server URL,
  # and the path to the validation key (relative to this Vagrantfile).
  #
  # The Hosted Chef platform uses HTTPS. Substitute your organization for
  # ORGNAME in the URL and validation key.
  #
  # If you have your own Chef Server, use the appropriate URL, which may be
  # HTTP instead of HTTPS depending on your configuration. Also change the
  # validation key to validation.pem.
  #
  # config.vm.provision "chef_client" do |chef|
  #   chef.chef_server_url     = "https://api.opscode.com/organizations/ORGNAME"
  #   chef.validation_key_path = "ORGNAME-validator.pem"
  # end
  #
  # If you're using the Hosted Chef platform, your validator client is
  # ORGNAME-validator, replacing ORGNAME with your organization name.
  #
  # If you have your own Chef Server, the default validation client name is
  # chef-validator, unless you changed the configuration.
  #
  #   chef.validation_client_name = "ORGNAME-validator"
  #
  # Chef Client will automatically install the latest version of Chef for you.
  # This can be configured in the provisioner block:
  #
  # config.vm.provision "chef_client" do |chef|
  #   chef.version = "11.16.4"
  # end
  #
  # Alternative you can disable the installation of Chef entirely:
  #
  # config.vm.provision "chef_client" do |chef|
  #   chef.install = false
  # end

  # Enable provisioning with Chef Apply, specifying an inline recipe to execute
  # on the target system.
  #
  # config.vm.provision "chef_apply" do |chef|
  #   chef.recipe = <<-RECIPE
  #     package "curl"
  #   RECIPE
  # end
  #
  # Chef Apply will automatically install the latest version of Chef for you.
  # This can be configured in the provisioner block:
  #
  # config.vm.provision "chef_apply" do |chef|
  #   chef.version = "11.16.4"
  # end
end
