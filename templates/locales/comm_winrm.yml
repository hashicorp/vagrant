        Message: %{message}

      connection_refused: |-
        WinRM connection was refused! This usually happens if the VM failed to
        boot properly. Some steps to try to fix this: First, try reloading your
        VM with `vagrant reload`, since a simple restart sometimes fixes things.
        If that doesn't work, destroy your VM and recreate it with a `vagrant destroy`
        followed by a `vagrant up`. If that doesn't work, contact a Vagrant
        maintainer (support channels listed on the website) for more assistance.
      connection_reset: |-
        WinRM connection was reset! This usually happens when the machine is
        taking too long to reboot. First, try reloading your machine with
        `vagrant reload`, since a simple restart sometimes fixes things.
        If that doesn't work, destroy your machine and recreate it with
        a `vagrant destroy` followed by a `vagrant up`. If that doesn't work,
        contact support.
      connection_timeout: |-
        Vagrant timed out while attempting to connect via WinRM. This usually
        means that the VM booted, but there are issues with the WinRM configuration
        or network connectivity issues. Please try to `vagrant reload` or
        `vagrant up` again.
      disconnected: |-
        The WinRM connection was unexpectedly closed by the remote end. This
        usually indicates that WinRM within the guest machine was unable to
        properly start up. Please boot the VM in GUI mode to check whether
        it is booting properly.
      no_route: |-
        While attempting to connect with WinRM, a "no route to host" (EHOSTUNREACH)
        error was received. Please verify your network settings are correct
        and try again.
      host_down: |-
        While attempting to connect with WinRM, a "host is down" (EHOSTDOWN)
        error was received. Please verify your WinRM settings are correct
        and try again.
