    errors:
      public_key_directory_failure: |-
        Vagrant failed to properly discover the correct paths for the
        temporary directory and user profile directory on the Windows
        guest. Please ensure the guest is properly configured.
      network_winrm_required: |-
        Configuring networks on Windows requires the communicator to be
        set to WinRM. To do this, add the following to your Vagrantfile:

          config.vm.communicator = "winrm"

        Note that the Windows guest must be configured to accept insecure
        WinRM connections, and the WinRM port must be forwarded properly from
        the guest machine. This is not always done by default.
      rename_computer_failed: |-
        Renaming the Windows guest failed. Most often this is because you've
        specified a FQDN instead of just a host name.

        Ensure the new guest name is properly formatted. Standard names may
        contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-), but no
        spaces or periods (.). The name may not consist entirely of digits.
