        to mount from using the `smb_host` option to the synced folder.

        to work on Windows. You have version: '%{version}'. Please update

      windows_admin_required: |-
        SMB shared folders on Windows hosts require running Vagrant with
        administrative privileges. This is a limitation of Windows itself,
        since creating new network shares requires admin privileges.
        Please try again in a console with proper permissions or use
        another synced folder type.
      windows_darwin_host_required: |-
        SMB shared folders are only available when Vagrant is running
        on Windows or Mac OS X. The guest machine can be running a different OS.
        Please use another synced folder type.
