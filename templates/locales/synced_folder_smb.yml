      You will be asked for the username and password to use for the SMB

      Windows account.

    errors:
      define_share_failed: |-
        Exporting an SMB share failed! Details about the failure are shown
        below. Please inspect the error message and correct any problems.

        Host path: %{host}

        Stderr: %{stderr}

        Stdout: %{stdout}
      no_routable_host_addr: |-
        We couldn't detect an IP address that was routable to this
        machine from the guest machine! Please verify networking is properly
        setup in the guest machine and that it is able to access this
        host.

        As another option, you can manually specify an IP for the machine
        to mount from using the `smb_host` option to the synced folder. This
        is mandatory if the host system is not Windows because the detection
        of the host IP address is not supported yet on non-Windows hosts.
      powershell_error: |-
        An error occurred while executing a PowerShell script. This error
        is shown below. Please read the error message and see if this is
        a configuration error with your system. If it is not, then please
        report a bug.

        Script: %{script}
        Error:

        %{stderr}
      powershell_version: |-
        PowerShell version 3 or later is required for SMB synced folders
        to work on Windows. You have version: '%{version}'. Please update
        your PowerShell installation.
      windows_admin_required: |-
        SMB shared folders require running Vagrant with administrative
        privileges. This is a limitation of Windows, since creating new
        network shares requires admin privileges. Please try again in a
        console with proper permissions or use another synced folder type.
      smb_id_required: |-
        SMB shared folders require a unique identifier in the 'smb_id'
        configuration key when the host system is not Windows. The identifier
        must be equal to the name of the SMB share under which the shared folder
        is available. Please provide this key for the following shared folder:

        %{id}
