      not_supported: |-
        It appears your machine doesn't support SMB, has not been
        properly configured for SMB, or there is not an adapter to
        enable SMB on this machine for Vagrant. Ensure SMB host
        functionality is available on this machine and try again.
      start_failed: |-
        Vagrant failed to automatically start the SMB service. Ensure the
        required services can be started and try again.

      credentials_missing: |-
        Vagrant SMB synced folders require the account password to be stored
        in an NT compatible format. Please update your sharing settings to
        enable a Windows compatible password and try again.

        Vagrant is unable to setup a requested SMB share. An SMB share already
        exists with the given name.

      list_failed: |-
        Vagrant failed to generate a list of local SMB shares. Please try
        running the command again.
      no_routable_host_addr: |-
        We couldn't detect an IP address that was routable to this
        machine from the guest machine! Please verify networking is properly
        setup in the guest machine and that it is able to access this
        host.

        As another option, you can manually specify an IP for the machine
        to mount from using the `smb_host` option to the synced folder.
      powershell_version: |-
        PowerShell version 3 or later is required for SMB synced folders
        to work on Windows. You have version: '%{version}'. Please update
        your PowerShell installation.
      windows_admin_required: |-
        SMB shared folders require running Vagrant with administrative
        privileges. This is a limitation of Windows, since creating new
        network shares requires admin privileges. Please try again in a
        console with proper permissions or use another synced folder type.
      windows_host_required: |-
        SMB shared folders are only available when Vagrant is running
        on Windows. The guest machine can be running non-Windows. Please use
        another synced folder type.
