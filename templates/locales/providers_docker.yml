      Warning: When using a remote Docker host, forwarded ports will NOT be
      immediately available on your machine. They will still be forwarded on
      the remote machine, however, so if you have a way to access the remote
      machine, then you should be able to access those ports there. This is
      not an error, it is only an informational message.
    host_machine_needed: |-
      Docker host is required. One will be created if necessary...
    host_machine_ready: |-
      Docker host VM is already ready.
    host_machine_starting: |-

    logs_host_state_unknown: |-
      This container requires a host VM, and the state of that VM
      is unknown. Run `vagrant up` to verify that the container and
      its host VM is running, then try again.
    network_bridge_gateway_invalid: |-
      The provided gateway IP address is invalid (%{gateway}). Please
      provide a valid IP address.
    network_bridge_gateway_outofbounds: |-
      The provided gateway IP (%{gateway}) is not within the defined
      subnet (%{subnet}). Please provide an IP address within the
      defined subnet.
    network_bridge_gateway_request: |-
      Gateway IP address for %{interface} interface [%{default_gateway}]:
    network_bridge_iprange_info: |-
      When an explicit address is not provided to a container attached
      to this bridged network, docker will supply an address to the
      container. This is independent of the local DHCP service that
      may be available on the network.
    network_bridge_iprange_invalid: |-
      The provided IP address range is invalid (%{range}). Please
      provide a valid range.
    network_bridge_iprange_outofbounds: |-

    run_command_required: |-
      `vagrant docker-run` requires a command to execute. This command
      must be specified after a `--` in the command line. This is used
      to separate possible machine names and options from the actual
      command to execute. An example is shown below:

        vagrant docker-run web -- rails new .

    running: |-
      Container is starting. Output will stream in below...
    running_detached: |-
      Container is started detached.
    ssh_through_host_vm: |-
      SSH will be proxied through the Docker virtual machine since we're
      not running Docker natively. This is just a notice, and not an error.
    subnet_exists: |-
      A network called '%{network_name}' using subnet '%{subnet}' is already in use.
      Using '%{network_name}' instead of creating a new network...
    synced_folders_changed: |-
      Vagrant has noticed that the synced folder definitions have changed.
      With Docker, these synced folder changes won't take effect until you
      destroy the container and recreate it.
    waiting_for_running: |-
      Waiting for container to enter "running" state...
    volume_path_not_expanded: |-
      Host path `%{host}` exists as a `volumes` key and is a folder on disk. Vagrant
      will not expand this key like it used to and instead leave it as is defined.
      If this folder is intended to be used, make sure its full path is defined
      in your `volumes` config. More information can be found on volumes in the
      docker compose documentation.

      not_provisioning: |-
        The following provisioners require a communicator, though none is available (this container does not support SSH).
        Not running the following provisioners:
        - %{provisioners}

    status:
      host_state_unknown: |-
        The host VM for the Docker containers appears to not be running
        or is currently inaccessible. Because of this, we can't determine
        the state of the containers on that host. Run `vagrant up` to
        bring up the host VM again.
      not_created: |-
        The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
        create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
        default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
        then the machine is not created for that environment.
      preparing: |-
        Vagrant is preparing to start this Docker container. Run `vagrant up`
        to continue.
      running: |-
        The container is created and running. You can stop it using
        `vagrant halt`, see logs with `vagrant docker-logs`, and
        kill/destroy it with `vagrant destroy`.
      stopped: |-
        The container is created but not running. You can run it again
        with `vagrant up`. If the container always goes to "stopped"
        right away after being started, it is because the command being
        run exits and doesn't keep running.

    errors:
      build_error: |-
        Vagrant received unknown output from `docker build` while building a container: %{result}
      compose_lock_timeout: |-
        Vagrant encountered a timeout waiting for the docker compose driver
        to become available. Please try to run your command again. If you
        continue to experience this error it may be resolved by disabling
        parallel execution.
      docker_compose_not_installed: |-
        Vagrant has been instructed to use to use the Compose driver for the
        Docker plugin but was unable to locate the `docker-compose` executable.
        Ensure that `docker-compose` is installed and available on the PATH.
      not_created: |-
        The container hasn't been created yet.
      not_running: |-
        The container is not currently running.
      communicator_non_docker: |-
        The "docker_hostvm" communicator was specified on a machine that
        is not provided by the Docker provider. This is a bug with your
        Vagrantfile. Please contact the creator of your Vagrant environment
        and notify them to not use this communicator for anything except the
        "docker" provider.
      config:
        both_build_and_image_and_git: |-
          Only one of "build_dir", "git_repo" or "image" can be set
        build_dir_invalid: |-
          "build_dir" must exist and contain a Dockerfile
        git_repo_invalid: |-
          "git_repo" must be a valid repository URL
        build_dir_or_image: |-
          One of "build_dir", "git_repo" or "image" must be set
        compose_configuration_hash: |-
          "compose_configuration" must be a hash
        compose_force_vm: |-
          Docker compose is not currently supported from within proxy VM.
        git_repo_invalid: |-
          "git_repo" must be a valid git URL
        create_args_array: |-
          "create_args" must be an array
        invalid_link: |-
          Invalid link (should be 'name:alias'): "%{link}"
        invalid_vagrantfile: |-
          "vagrant_vagrantfile" must point to a Vagrantfile that exists.
      docker_provider_nfs_without_privileged: |-
        You've configured a NFS synced folder but didn't enable privileged
        mode for the container. Please set the `privileged` option to true
        on the provider block from your Vagrantfile, recreate the container
        and try again.
      docker_provider_image_not_configured: |-
        The base Docker image has not been set for the '%{name}' VM!
      execute_error: |-
        A Docker command executed by Vagrant didn't complete successfully!
        The command run along with the output from the command is shown
        below.

        Command: %{command}

        Stderr: %{stderr}

        Stdout: %{stdout}
      exec_command_required: |-
        The "docker-exec" command requires a command to execute. This command
        must be specified after a "--" in the command line. This is used to
        separate machine name and options from the actual command to execute.
        An example is show below:

          $ vagrant docker-exec -t nginx -- bash

      host_vm_communicator_not_ready: |-
        The Docker provider was able to bring up the host VM successfully
        but the host VM is still reporting that SSH is unavailable. This
        sometimes happens with certain providers due to bugs in the
        underlying hypervisor, and can be fixed with a `vagrant reload`.
        The ID for the host VM is shown below for convenience.

        If this does not fix it, please verify that the host VM provider
        is functional and properly configured.

        Host VM ID: %{id}
      network_address_invalid: |-
        The configured network address is not valid within the configured
        subnet of the defined network. Please update the network settings
        and try again.

          Configured address: %{address}
          Network name:       %{network_name}
      network_address_required: |-
        An IP address is required if not using `type: "dhcp"` or not specifying a `subnet`.
      network_invalid_option: |-
        Invalid option given for docker network for guest "%{container}". Must specify either
        a `subnet` or use `type: "dhcp"`.
      network_name_missing: |-
        The Docker provider is unable to connect the container to the
        defined network due to a missing network name. Please validate
        your configuration and try again.

          Container: %{container}
          Network Number: %{index}
      network_name_undefined: |-
        The Docker provider was unable to configure networking using the
        provided network name `%{network_name}`. Please ensure the network
        name is correct and exists, then try again.
      network_no_interfaces: |-
        The Docker provider was unable to list any available interfaces to bridge
        the public network with.
      network_subnet_invalid: |-
        The configured network subnet is not valid for the defined network.
        Please update the network settings and try again.

          Configured subnet: %{subnet}
          Network name:      %{network_name}
      package_not_supported: |-
        The "package" command is not supported with the Docker provider.
        If you'd like to commit or push your Docker container, please SSH
        into the host VM (if there is one), and run `docker commit` and
        so on manually.
      state_not_running: |-
        The container never entered the "running" state, or entered it
        briefly but reverted back to another state. Please verify that
        the configuration of the container is correct.

        If you meant for this container to not remain running, please
        set the Docker provider configuration "remains_running" to "false":

          config.vm.provider "docker" do |d|
            d.remains_running = false
          end

      state_stopped: |-
        The container started either never left the "stopped" state or
        very quickly reverted to the "stopped" state. This is usually
        because the container didn't execute a command that kept it running,
        and usually indicates a misconfiguration.

        If you meant for this container to not remain running, please
        set the Docker provider configuration "remains_running" to "false":

          config.vm.provider "docker" do |d|
            d.remains_running = false
          end

      suspend_not_supported: |-
        The "suspend" command is not supported with the Docker provider.
        Docker containers don't natively support suspend. If you're using
        a host machine, you can suspend the host machine by finding it
        in `vagrant global-status` and using `vagrant suspend <id>`.
      synced_folder_non_docker: |-
        The "docker" synced folder type can't be used because the  provider
        in use is not Docker. This synced folder type only works with the
        Docker provider. The provider this machine is using is: %{provider}
      vagrantfile_not_found: |-
        The configured host VM Vagrantfile could not be found. Please fix
        the Vagrantfile for this Docker environment to point to a valid
        host VM.
