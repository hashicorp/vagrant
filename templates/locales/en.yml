      config_upgrade_messages: |-
        There were warnings and/or errors while loading your Vagrantfile.
        Your Vagrantfile was written for an earlier version of Vagrant,
        and while Vagrant does the best it can to remain backwards
        compatible, there are some cases where things have changed
        significantly enough to warrant a message. These messages are
        shown below.

        %{output}
      moving_home_dir: "Moving old Vagrant home directory to new location: %{directory}"
      home_dir_migration_failed: |-
        Both an old and new Vagrant home directory exist. Only the new one will
        be used. Please merge the old directory into the new directory if you'd
        like to use the old data as well.

        Old: %{old}
        New: %{new}
      upgraded_v1_dotfile: |-
        A Vagrant 1.0.x state file was found for this environment. Vagrant has
        gone ahead and auto-upgraded this to the latest format. Everything
        should continue working as normal. Beware, however, that older versions
        of Vagrant may no longer be used with this environment.

        However, in case anything went wrong, the old dotfile was backed up
        to the location below. If everything is okay, it is safe to remove
        this backup.

    errors:
      active_machine_with_different_provider: |-
        An active machine was found with a different provider. Vagrant
        currently allows each machine to be brought up with only a single
        provider at a time. A future version will remove this limitation.
        Until then, please destroy the existing machine to up with a new
        provider.

        Machine name: %{name}
        Active provider: %{active_provider}
        Requested provider: %{requested_provider}
      base_vm_not_found: The base VM with the name '%{name}' was not found.
      box_not_found: Box '%{name}' could not be found.
      box_provider_doesnt_match: |-
        The box you attempted to add doesn't match the provider you specified.

        Provider expected: %{expected}
        Provider of box: %{actual}
      box_upgrade_required: |-
        The box '%{name}' is still stored on disk in the Vagrant 1.0.x
        format. This box must be upgraded in order to work properly with
        this version of Vagrant.
      cli_invalid_options: |-
        An invalid option was specified. The help for this command
        is available below.

        %{help}
      cli_invalid_usage: |-
        This command was not invoked properly. The help for this command is
        available below.

        %{help}
      config_invalid: |-
        There are errors in the configuration of this machine. Please fix
        the following errors and try again:

        %{errors}
      config_upgrade_errors: |-
        Because there were errors upgrading your Vagrantfiles, Vagrant
        can no longer continue. Please fix the errors above and try again.
      destroy_requires_force: |-
        Destroy doesn't have a TTY to ask for confirmation. Please pass the
        `--force` flag to force a destroy, otherwise attach a TTY so that
        the destroy can be confirmed.
      dotfile_is_directory: |-
        The local file Vagrant uses to store data ".vagrant" already exists
        and is a directory! If you are in your home directory, then please run
        this command in another directory. If you aren't in a home directory,
        then please rename ".vagrant" to something else, or configure Vagrant
        to use another filename by modifying `config.vagrant.dotfile_name`.
      dotfile_upgrade_json_error: |-
        A Vagrant 1.0.x local state file was found. Vagrant is able to upgrade
        this to the latest format automatically, however various checks are
        put in place to verify data isn't incorrectly deleted. In this case,
        the old state file was not valid JSON. Vagrant 1.0.x would store state
        as valid JSON, meaning that this file was probably tampered with or
        manually edited. Vagrant's auto-upgrade process cannot continue in this
        case.

        In most cases, this can be resolve by simply removing the state file.
        Note however though that if Vagrant was previously managing virtual
        machines, they may be left in an "orphan" state. That is, if they are
        running or exist, they'll have to manually be removed.

        If you're unsure what to do, ask the Vagrant mailing list or contact
        support.

        State file path: %{state_file}
      environment_locked: |-
        An instance of Vagrant is already running. Only one instance of Vagrant
        may run at any given time to avoid problems with VirtualBox inconsistencies
        occurring. Please wait for the other instance of Vagrant to end and then
        try again.
      gem_command_in_bundler: |-
        You cannot run the `vagrant gem` command while in a bundler environment.
        Bundler messes around quite a bit with the RubyGem load paths and gems
        installed via `vagrant gem` are excluded by Bundler.

        Instead, please include your Vagrant plugins in your Gemfile itself.
      guest:
        invalid_class: |-
          The specified guest class does not inherit from a proper guest
          component class. The guest class must inherit from this.

          The specified guest class was: %{guest}
        unknown_type: |-
          The specified guest type is unknown: %{guest}. Please change this
          to a proper value.
        unspecified: |-
          A VM guest type must be specified! This is done via the `config.vm.guest`
          configuration value. Please read the documentation online for more information.
      home_dir_not_accessible: |-
        The home directory you specified is not accessible. The home
        directory that Vagrant uses must be both readable and writable.

        You specified: %{home_path}
      interrupted: |-
        Vagrant exited after cleanup due to external interrupt.
      local_data_dir_not_accessible: |-
        The directory Vagrant will use to store local environment-specific
        state is not accessible. The directory specified as the local data
        directory must be both readable and writable for the user that is
        running Vagrant.

        Local data directory: %{local_data_path}
      machine_guest_not_ready: |-
        Guest-specific operations were attempted on a machine that is not
        ready for guest communication. This should not happen and a bug
        should be reported.
      machine_not_found: |-
        The machine with the name '%{name}' was not found configured for
        this Vagrant environment.
      machine_state_invalid: |-
        An internal error has occurred! The provider of the machine you're
        trying to work with reported an invalid state. This is a bug with
        the provider you're using, and not with Vagrant itself or with
        any configuration you may have done. Please report this bug to
        the proper location.
      multi_vm_required: |-
        A multi-vm environment is required for name specification to this command.
      multi_vm_target_required: |-
        This command requires a specific VM name to target in a multi-VM environment.
      no_env: |-
        A Vagrant environment is required to run this command. Run `vagrant init`
        to set one up.
      plugin_load_error: |-
        The plugin "%{plugin}" could not be found. Please make sure that it is
        properly installed via `vagrant gem`.
      port_collision_resume: |-
        This VM cannot be resumed, because the forwarded ports would collide with
        another running virtual machine. Normally, Vagrant will attempt to fix this
        for you but VirtualBox only allows forwarded ports to change if the VM is
        powered off. Therefore, please reload your VM or halt the other running
        VMs to continue.
      provider_not_found: |-
        The provider '%{provider}' could not be found, but was requested to
        back the machine '%{machine}'. Please use a provider that exists.
      scp_permission_denied: |-
        Failed to upload a file to the guest VM via SCP due to a permissions
        error. This is normally because the user running Vagrant doesn't have
        read permission on the file. Please set proper permissions on the file:

        %{path}
      scp_unavailable: |-
        SSH server on the guest doesn't support SCP. Please install the necessary
        software to enable SCP on your guest operating system.
      shared_folder_create_failed: |-
        Failed to create the following shared folder on the host system. This is
        usually because Vagrant does not have sufficient permissions to create
        the folder.

        %{path}

        Please create the folder manually or specify another path to share.
      ssh_authentication_failed: |-
        SSH authentication failed! This is typically caused by the public/private
        keypair for the SSH user not being properly set on the guest VM. Please
        verify that the guest VM is setup with the proper public key, and that
        the private key path for Vagrant is setup properly as well.
      ssh_bad_exit_status: |-
        The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
        Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

        %{command}
      ssh_connection_refused: |-
        SSH connection was refused! This usually happens if the VM failed to
        boot properly. Some steps to try to fix this: First, try reloading your
        VM with `vagrant reload`, since a simple restart sometimes fixes things.
        If that doesn't work, destroy your VM and recreate it with a `vagrant destroy`
        followed by a `vagrant up`. If that doesn't work, contact a Vagrant
        maintainer (support channels listed on the website) for more assistance.
      ssh_connection_timeout: |-
        Vagrant timed out while attempting to connect via SSH. This usually
        means that the VM booted, but there are issues with the SSH configuration
        or network connectivity issues. Please try to `vagrant reload` or
        `vagrant up` again.
      ssh_disconnected: |-
        The SSH connection was unexpectedly closed by the remote end. This
        usually indicates that SSH within the guest machine was unable to
        properly start up. Please boot the VM in GUI mode to check whether
        it is booting properly.
      ssh_host_down: |-
        While attempting to connect with SSH, a "host is down" (EHOSTDOWN)
        error was received. Please verify your SSH settings are correct
        and try again.
      ssh_key_bad_permissions: |-
        The private key to connect to this box via SSH has invalid permissions
        set on it. The permissions of the private key should be set to 0600, otherwise SSH will
        ignore the key. Vagrant tried to do this automatically for you but failed. Please set the
        permissions on the following file to 0600 and then try running this command again:

        %{key_path}
      ssh_key_type_not_supported: |-
        The private key you're attempting to use with this Vagrant box uses
        an unsupported encryption type. The SSH library Vagrant uses does not support
        this key type. Please use `ssh-rsa` or `ssh-dss` instead.
      ssh_not_ready: |-
        The provider for this Vagrant-managed machine is reporting that it
        is not yet ready for SSH. Depending on your provider this can carry
        different meanings. Make sure your machine is created and running and
        try again. Additionally, check the output of `vagrant status` to verify
        that the machine is in the state that you expect. If you continue to
        get this error message, please view the documentation for the provider
        you're using.
      ssh_port_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant couldn't determine the SSH port for your VM! Vagrant attempts to
        automatically find a forwarded port that matches your `config.ssh.guest_port`
        (default: 22) value and uses this for SSH. Alternatively, if `config.ssh.port`
        is set, it will use this.

        However, in this case Vagrant was unable to find a forwarded port that matches
        the guest port and `config.ssh.port` is not set!

        Please make sure that you have a forwarded port that goes to the configured
        guest port value, or specify an explicit SSH port with `config.ssh.port`.
      ssh_unavailable: "`ssh` binary could not be found. Is an SSH client installed?"
      ssh_unavailable_windows: |-
        `vagrant ssh` isn't available on the Windows platform. You are still able
        to SSH into the virtual machine if you get a Windows SSH client (such as
        PuTTY). The authentication information is shown below:

        Host: %{host}
        Port: %{port}
        Username: %{username}
        Private key: %{key_path}
      ui_expects_tty: |-
        Vagrant is attempting to interface with the UI in a way that requires
        a TTY. Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration
        switches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant
        with TTY.
      unimplemented_provider_action: |-
        Vagrant attempted to call the action '%{action}' on the provider
        '%{provider}', but this provider doesn't support this action. This
        is probably a bug in either the provider or the plugin calling this
        action, and should be reported.
      vagrantfile_exists: |-
        `Vagrantfile` already exists in this directory. Remove it before
        running `vagrant init`.
      vagrantfile_syntax_error: |-
        There is a syntax error in the following Vagrantfile. The syntax error
        message is reproduced below for convenience:

        %{file}
      vboxmanage_error: |-
        There was an error executing the following command with VBoxManage:

        %{command}

        For more information on the failure, enable detailed logging with
        VAGRANT_LOG.
      virtualbox_invalid_version: |-
        Vagrant has detected that you have a version of VirtualBox installed
        that is not supported. Please install one of the supported versions
        listed below to use Vagrant:

        %{supported_versions}
      virtualbox_kernel_module_not_loaded: |-
        VirtualBox is complaining that the kernel module is not loaded. Please
        run `VBoxManage --version` to see the error message which should contain
        instructions on how to fix this error.
      virtualbox_install_incomplete: |-
        VirtualBox is complaining that the installation is incomplete. Please
        run `VBoxManage --version` to see the error message which should contain
        instructions on how to fix this error.
      virtualbox_no_room_for_high_level_network: |-
        There is no available slots on the VirtualBox VM for the configured
        high-level network interfaces. "private_network" and "public_network"
        network configurations consume a single network adapter slot on the
        VirtualBox VM. VirtualBox limits the number of slots to 8, and it
        appears that every slot is in use. Please lower the number of used
        network adapters.
      virtualbox_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant could not detect VirtualBox! Make sure VirtualBox is properly installed.
        Vagrant uses the `VBoxManage` binary that ships with VirtualBox, and requires
        this to be available on the PATH. If VirtualBox is installed, please find the
        `VBoxManage` binary and add it to the PATH environmental variable.
      vm_creation_required: |-
        VM must be created before running this command. Run `vagrant up` first.
      vm_inaccessible: |-
        Your VM has become "inaccessible." Unfortunately, this is a critical error
        with VirtualBox that Vagrant can not cleanly recover from. Please open VirtualBox
        and clear out your inaccessible virtual machines or find a way to fix
        them.
      vm_no_match: |-
        No virtual machines matched the regular expression given.
      vm_not_found: |-
        A VM by the name of %{name} was not found.
      vm_not_running: |-
        VM must be running to open SSH connection. Run `vagrant up`
        to start the virtual machine.

          `vagrant gem` is used to install Vagrant plugins via the RubyGems
          system. In fact, `vagrant gem` is just a frontend to the actual `gem`
          interface, with the difference being that Vagrant sets up a custom

          The VM is in an aborted state. This means that it was abruptly
          stopped without properly closing the session. Run `vagrant up`
          to resume this virtual machine. If any problems persist, you may
          have to destroy and restart the virtual machine.
        gurumeditation: |-
          The VM is in the "guru meditation" state. This is a rare case which means
          that an internal error in VitualBox caused the VM to fail. This is always
          the sign of a bug in VirtualBox. You can try to bring your VM back online
          with a `vagrant up`.
        inaccessible: |-
          The VM is inaccessible! This is a rare case which means that VirtualBox
          can't find your VM configuration. This usually happens when upgrading
          VirtualBox, moving to a new computer, etc. Please consult VirtualBox
          for how to handle this issue.

          The VM is paused. This VM may have been paused via the VirtualBox
          GUI or the VBoxManage command line interface. To unpause, please
          use the VirtualBox GUI and/or VBoxManage command line interface so
          that vagrant would be able to control the VM again.
        poweroff: |-
          The VM is powered off. To restart the VM, simply run `vagrant up`
        running: |-
          The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
          shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
          suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
          simply run `vagrant up`.
        saving: |-
          The VM is currently saving its state. In a few moments this state
          should transition to "saved." Please run `vagrant status` again
