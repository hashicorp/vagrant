        are printed below:

        %{messages}
      dotfile_is_directory: |-
        The local file Vagrant uses to store data ".vagrant" already exists
        and is a directory! If you are in your home directory, then please run
        this command in another directory. If you aren't in a home directory,
        then please rename ".vagrant" to something else, or configure Vagrant
        to use another filename by modifying `config.vagrant.dotfile_name`.
      environment_locked: |-
        An instance of Vagrant is already running. Only one instance of Vagrant
        may run at any given time to avoid problems with VirtualBox inconsistencies
        occurring. Please wait for the other instance of Vagrant to end and then

        invalid_class: |-
          The specified guest class does not inherit from `Vagrant::Guest::Base`.
          The specified guest class must inherit from this class.

          The specified guest class was: %{guest}

      scp_unavailable: |-
        SSH server on the guest doesn't support SCP. Please install the necessary
        software to enable SCP on your guest operating system.
      ssh_authentication_failed: |-
        SSH authentication failed! This is typically caused by the public/private
        keypair for the SSH user not being properly set on the guest VM. Please
        verify that the guest VM is setup with the proper public key, and that
        the private key path for Vagrant is setup properly as well.
      ssh_bad_exit_status: |-
        The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
        Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

        %{command}

        The output of the command prior to failing is outputted below:

        %{output}
      ssh_connection_refused: |-
        SSH connection was refused! This usually happens if the VM failed to
        boot properly. Some steps to try to fix this: First, try reloading your
        VM with `vagrant reload`, since a simple restart sometimes fixes things.
        If that doesn't work, destroy your VM and recreate it with a `vagrant destroy`
        followed by a `vagrant up`. If that doesn't work, contact a Vagrant
        maintainer (support channels listed on the website) for more assistance.
      ssh_key_bad_permissions: |-
        The private key to connect to this box via SSH has invalid permissions
        set on it. The permissions of the private key should be set to 0600, otherwise SSH will
        ignore the key. Vagrant tried to do this automatically for you but failed. Please set the
        permissions on the following file to 0600 and then try running this command again:

        %{key_path}
      ssh_port_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant couldn't determine the SSH port for your VM! This is a rare,
        exceptional event, and a bug should be filed. Please try recreating your
        VM (vagrant destroy, then vagrant up). Sorry!
      ssh_unavailable: "`ssh` binary could not be found. Is an SSH client installed?"
      ssh_unavailable_windows: |-
        `vagrant ssh` isn't available on the Windows platform. The
        vagrant.ppk file for use with Putty is available at:

          %{key_path}.ppk

        To use this create a new Putty session for `vagrant@localhost`
        on port `%{ssh_port}`, in the Connection>SSH>Auth
        configuration section navigate to the vagrant.ppk file,
        select it, save the session for later use, and connect.

        For a more detailed guide please consult:

      vagrantfile_exists: |-
        `Vagrantfile` already exists in this directory. Remove it before
        running `vagrant init`.
      vagrantfile_syntax_error: |-
        There is a syntax error in the following Vagrantfile. The syntax error
        message is reproduced below for convenience:

        %{file}
      virtualbox_invalid_version: |-
        Vagrant has detected that you have VirtualBox version %{version} installed!
        Vagrant requires that you use at least VirtualBox version 4.1. Please install
        a more recent version of VirtualBox to continue.

        Early versions of Vagrant support earlier versions of VirtualBox. Specifically,
        the 0.7.x series supports VirtualBox 4.0.x and the 0.6.x series supports VirtualBox
        3.2.x. Please use the version you need.

        Any newer versions may not be supported yet. Please check the mailing list
        for any announcements of newer versions.
      virtualbox_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant could not detect VirtualBox! Make sure VirtualBox is properly installed.
        If VirtualBox is installed, it may be an incorrect version. Vagrant currently
        requires VirtualBox 4.1.x. Please install the proper version to continue.

        If you have an older or newer version of VirtualBox, please make sure you're
        using the proper version of Vagrant. Ask the mailing list if you have questions.
      virtualbox_not_detected_win64: |-
        Vagrant could not detect VirtualBox! Make sure VirtualBox is properly installed
        with version 4.0.0 or higher.

        Additionally, it appears you're on 64-bit Windows. If this is the case, and
        VirtualBox is properly installed with the correct version, then please make
        sure you're running Vagrant via JRuby on a 64-bit Java runtime. For more
        information on how to set this up and how to verify it is properly setup,
        please view the guide online at:

          The VM is inaccessible! This is a rare case which means that VirtualBox
          can't find your VM configuration. This usually happens when upgrading

            Vagrant found a port collision for the specified port and virtual machine.
            While this port was marked to be auto-corrected, the ports in the

            Vagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they

            ports! The '%{name}' forwarded port (%{host_port}) is already in use on the host
            machine.

            To fix this, modify your current projects Vagrantfile to use another
            port. Example, where '1234' would be replaced by a unique host port:

              config.vm.forward_port("%{name}", %{guest_port}, 1234)

            double check that the box file is properly packaged.

          failed: |-
            The box file you're attempting to add is invalid. This can be
            commonly attributed to typos in the path given to the box add
            command. Another common case of this is invalid packaging of the
            box itself.

            remove this file or specify a different file name for outputting.

            A directory was not specified to package. This should never happen
            and is a result of an internal inconsistency.

          An error occurred while trying to download the specified box. This most
          often happens if there is no internet connection or the address is

        server_url_required: |-
          Chef server provisioning requires that the `config.chef.chef_server_url` be set to the
          URL of your chef server. Examples include "http://12.12.12.12:4000" and
          "http://myserver.com:4000" (the port of course can be different, but 4000 is the default)

        unsupported_host_only: |-
          Host only networking is very distro-specific. Vagrant has support for many
          distros built-in: Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, and RedHat. The distro of your VM
          couldn't be detected, or isn't supported for host only networking.

          Most of the time this is simply due to the fact that no one has contributed
          back the SSH commands necessary to set this up. Please report a bug and this
          will be fixed for your distro.
        unsupported_host_name: |-
          Setting host name is currently only supported on Debian, Ubuntu and RedHat.
          If you'd like your guest OS to be supported, please open a ticket on the
          project.

          Mounting NFS shared folders failed. This is most often caused by the NFS
          client software not being installed on the guest machine. Please verify
          that the NFS client software is properly installed, and consult any resources
          specific to the linux distro you're using for more information on how to
          do this.
