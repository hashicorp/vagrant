      The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
      on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
      up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
      that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
      with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
      "vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
    global_status_none: |-
      There are no active Vagrant environments on this computer! Or,
      you haven't destroyed and recreated Vagrant environments that were
      started with an older version of Vagrant.
    plugin_needs_reinstall: |-
      The following plugins were installed with a version of Vagrant
      that had different versions of underlying components. Because
      these component versions were changed (which rarely happens),
      the plugins must be uninstalled and reinstalled.

      To ensure that all the dependencies are properly updated as well
      it is _highly recommended_ to do a `vagrant plugin uninstall`
      prior to reinstalling.

      This message will not go away until all the plugins below are
      either uninstalled or uninstalled then reinstalled.

      The plugins below will not be loaded until they're uninstalled
      and reinstalled:

    post_up_message: |-
      Machine '%{name}' has a post `vagrant up` message. This is a message
      from the creator of the Vagrantfile, and not from Vagrant itself:

      %{message}
    provisioner_cleanup: |-

    rsync_auto_initial: |-
      Doing an initial rsync...
    rsync_auto_new_folders: |-
      New synced folders were added to the Vagrantfile since running
      `vagrant reload`. If these new synced folders are backed by rsync,
      they won't be automatically synced until a `vagrant reload` is run.
    rsync_auto_no_paths: |-
      There are no paths to watch! This is either because you have no
      synced folders using rsync, or any rsync synced folders you have
      have specified `rsync_auto` to be false.
    rsync_auto_path: |-
      Watching: %{path}
    rsync_auto_rsync_error: |-
      There was an error while executing rsync. The error is shown below.
      This may not be critical since rsync sometimes fails, but if this message
      repeats, then please fix the issue:

      %{message}
    rsync_communicator_not_ready: |-
      The machine is reporting that it is not ready for rsync to
      communicate with it. Verify that this machine is properly running.
    rsync_communicator_not_ready_callback: |-
      Failed to connect to remote machine. This is usually caused by the
      machine rebooting or being halted. Please make sure the machine is
      running, and modify a file to try again.

      using a proxy machine. RSync will sync to this proxy
      instead of directly to the environment itself.
    rsync_showing_output: "Showing rsync output..."
    rsync_ssh_password: |-
      The machine you're rsyncing folders to is configured to use
      password-based authentication. Vagrant can't script rsync to automatically
      enter this password, so you'll likely be prompted for a password
      shortly.

      If you don't want to have to do this, please enable automatic
      key insertion using `config.ssh.insert_key`.
    ssh_exec_password: |-
      The machine you're attempting to SSH into is configured to use
      password-based authentication. Vagrant can't script entering the
      password for you. If you're prompted for a password, please enter
      the same password you have configured in the Vagrantfile.
    stdin_cant_hide_input: |-
      Error! Your console doesn't support hiding input. We'll ask for
      input again below, but we WILL NOT be able to hide input. If this
      is a problem for you, ctrl-C to exit and fix your stdin.
    up_no_machines: |-
      No machines to bring up. This is usually because all machines are
      set to `autostart: false`, which means you have to explicitly specify
      the name of the machine to bring up.
    upgrading_home_path_v1_5: |-
      Vagrant is upgrading some internal state for the latest version.
      Please do not quit Vagrant at this time. While upgrading, Vagrant
      will need to copy all your boxes, so it will use a considerable
      amount of disk space. After it is done upgrading, the temporary disk
      space will be freed.

      Press ctrl-c now to exit if you want to remove some boxes or free
      up some disk space.

      batch_unexpected_error: |-
        An unexpected error occurred when executing the action on the
        '%{machine}' machine. Please report this as a bug:

        %{message}
      batch_vagrant_error: |-
        An error occurred while executing the action on the '%{machine}'
        machine. Please handle this error then try again:

        %{message}
      config_upgrade_messages: |-
        There were warnings and/or errors while loading your Vagrantfile
        for the machine '%{name}'.

        Your Vagrantfile was written for an earlier version of Vagrant,
        and while Vagrant does the best it can to remain backwards
        compatible, there are some cases where things have changed
        significantly enough to warrant a message. These messages are
        shown below.

        %{output}
      not_in_installer: |-
        You appear to be running Vagrant outside of the official installers.
        Note that the installers are what ensure that Vagrant has all required
        dependencies, and Vagrant assumes that these dependencies exist. By
        running outside of the installer environment, Vagrant may not function
        properly. To remove this warning, install Vagrant using one of the
        official packages from vagrantup.com.
      upgraded_v1_dotfile: |-
        A Vagrant 1.0.x state file was found for this environment. Vagrant has
        gone ahead and auto-upgraded this to the latest format. Everything
        should continue working as normal. Beware, however, that older versions
        of Vagrant may no longer be used with this environment.

        However, in case anything went wrong, the old dotfile was backed up
        to the location below. If everything is okay, it is safe to remove
        this backup.

        Backup: %{backup_path}

    errors:
      active_machine_with_different_provider: |-
        An active machine was found with a different provider. Vagrant
        currently allows each machine to be brought up with only a single
        provider at a time. A future version will remove this limitation.
        Until then, please destroy the existing machine to up with a new
        provider.

        Machine name: %{name}
        Active provider: %{active_provider}
        Requested provider: %{requested_provider}
      ansible_failed: |-
        Ansible failed to complete successfully. Any error output should be
        visible above. Please fix these errors and try again.
      ansible_playbook_app_not_found: |-
        The "ansible-playbook" program could not be found! Please verify
        that "ansible-playbook" is available on the PATH of your host
        system, and try again.

        If you haven't installed Ansible yet, please install Ansible
        on your system. Vagrant can't do this for you in a safe, automated
        way. Please see ansible.cc for more info.
      batch_multi_error: |-
        An error occurred while executing multiple actions in parallel.
        Any errors that occurred are shown below.

        %{message}
      box_add_no_matching_provider: |-
        The box you're attempting to add doesn't support the provider
        you requested. Please find an alternate box or use an alternate
        provider. Double-check your requested provider to verify you didn't
        simply misspell it.

        If you're adding a box from HashiCorp's Atlas, make sure the box is
        released.

        Name: %{name}
        Address: %{url}
        Requested provider: %{requested}
      box_add_no_matching_version: |-
        The box you're attempting to add has no available version that
        matches the constraints you requested. Please double-check your
        settings. Also verify that if you specified version constraints,
        that the provider you wish to use is available for these constriants.

        Box: %{name}
        Address: %{url}
        Constraints: %{constraints}
        Available versions: %{versions}
      box_add_short_not_found: |-
        The box '%{name}' could not be found or
        could not be accessed in the remote catalog. If this is a private
        box on HashiCorp's Atlas, please verify you're logged in via
        `vagrant login`. Also, please double-check the name. The expanded
        URL and error message are shown below:

        URL: %{url}
        Error: %{error}
      boot_bad_state: |-
        The guest machine entered an invalid state while waiting for it
        to boot. Valid states are '%{valid}'. The machine is in the
        '%{invalid}' state. Please verify everything is configured
        properly and try again.

        If the provider you're using has a GUI that comes with it,
        it is often helpful to open that and watch the machine, since the
        GUI often has more helpful error messages than Vagrant can retrieve.
        For example, if you're using VirtualBox, run `vagrant up` while the
        VirtualBox GUI is open.

        The primary issue for this error is that the provider you're using
        is not properly configured. This is very rarely a Vagrant issue.
      boot_timeout: |-
        Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot. This means that
        Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within
        the configured ("config.vm.boot_timeout" value) time period.

        If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that
        Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
        are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.

        If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
        working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
        problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
        Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
        as well.

        If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase
        the timeout ("config.vm.boot_timeout") value.
      box_add_exists: |-
        The box you're attempting to add already exists. Remove it before
        adding it again or add it with the `--force` flag.

        Name: %{name}
        Provider: %{provider}
        Version: %{version}
      box_add_direct_version: |-
        You specified a box version constraint with a direct box file
        path. Box version constraints only work with boxes from Vagrant
        Cloud or a custom box host. Please remove the version constraint
        and try again.
      box_add_metadata_multi_url: |-
        Multiple URLs for a box can't be specified when adding
        versioned boxes. Please specify a single URL to the box
        metadata (JSON) information. The full list of URLs you
        specified is shown below:

        %{urls}
      box_add_name_mismatch: |-
        The box you're adding has a name different from the name you
        requested. For boxes with metadata, you cannot override the name.
        If you're adding a box using `vagrant box add`, don't specify
        the `--name` parameter. If the box is being added via a Vagrantfile,
        change the `config.vm.box` value to match the name below.

        Requested name: %{requested_name}
        Actual name: %{actual_name}
      box_add_name_required: |-
        A name is required when adding a box file directly. Please pass
        the `--name` parameter to `vagrant box add`. See
        `vagrant box add -h` for more help.
      box_checksum_invalid_type: |-
        The specified checksum type is not supported by Vagrant: %{type}.
        Vagrant supports the following checksum types:

        md5, sha1, sha256
      box_checksum_mismatch: |-
        The checksum of the downloaded box did not match the expected
        value. Please verify that you have the proper URL setup and that
        you're downloading the proper file.

        Expected: %{expected}
        Received: %{actual}
      box_config_changing_box: |-
        While loading the Vagrantfile, the provider override specified
        a new box. This box, in turn, specified a different box. This isn't
        allowed, as it could lead to infinite recursion of Vagrant configuration
        loading. Please fix this.
      box_metadata_corrupted: |-
        The metadata associated with the box '%{name}' appears corrupted.
        This is most often caused by a disk issue or system crash. Please
        remove the box, re-add it, and try again.
      box_metadata_download_error: |-
        There was an error while downloading the metadata for this box.
        The error message is shown below:

        %{message}
      box_metadata_file_not_found: |-
        The "metadata.json" file for the box '%{name}' was not found.
        Boxes require this file in order for Vagrant to determine the
        provider it was made for. If you made the box, please add a
        "metadata.json" file to it. If someone else made the box, please
        notify the box creator that the box is corrupt. Documentation for
        box file format can be found at the URL below:

        http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes/format.html
      box_metadata_malformed: |-
        The metadata for the box was malformed. The exact error
        is shown below. Please contact the maintainer of the box so
        that this issue can be fixed.

        %{error}
      box_metadata_malformed_version: |-
        A version of the box you're loading is formatted in a way that
        Vagrant cannot parse: '%{version}'. Please reformat the version
        to be properly formatted. It should be in the format of

      box_remove_multi_provider: |-
        You requested to remove the box '%{name}'. This box has
        multiple providers. You must explicitly select a single
        provider to remove with `--provider`.

        Available providers: %{providers}
      box_remove_multi_version: |-
        You requested to remove the box '%{name}' with provider
        '%{provider}'. This box has multiple versions. You must
        explicitly specify which version you want to remove with
        the `--box-version` flag. The available versions for this
        box are:

        %{versions}
      box_remove_not_found: |-
        The box you requested to be removed could not be found. No
        boxes named '%{name}' could be found.
      box_remove_provider_not_found: |-
        You requested to remove the box '%{name}' with provider
        '%{provider}'. The box '%{name}' exists but not with
        the provider specified. Please double-check and try again.

        The providers for this are: %{providers}
      box_remove_version_not_found: |-
        You requested to remove the box '%{name}' version '%{version}' with
        provider '%{provider}', but that specific version of the box is
        not installed. Please double-check and try again. The available versions
        for this box are:

        %{versions}
      box_server_not_set: |-
        A URL to an Atlas server is not set, so boxes cannot be added with a
        shorthand ("mitchellh/precise64") format. You may also be seeing this
        error if you meant to type in a path to a box file which doesn't exist
        locally on your system.

        To set a URL to an Atlas server, set the `VAGRANT_SERVER_URL`
        environmental variable. Or, if you meant to use a file path, make sure
        the path to the file is valid.
      box_update_multi_provider: |-
        You requested to update the box '%{name}'. This box has
        multiple providers. You must explicitly select a single
        provider to remove with `--provider`.

        Available providers: %{providers}
      box_update_no_box: |-
        Box '%{name}' not installed, can't check for updates.
      box_update_no_metadata: |-
        The box '%{name}' is not a versioned box. The box was added
        directly instead of from a box catalog. Vagrant can only
        check the versions of boxes that were added from a catalog
        such as from the public Vagrant Server.
      box_update_no_name: |-
        This machine doesn't have a box. Won't update anything.
      bundler_disabled: |-
        Vagrant's built-in bundler management mechanism is disabled because
        Vagrant is running in an external bundler environment. In these
        cases, plugin management does not work with Vagrant. To install
        plugins, use your own Gemfile. To load plugins, either put the
        plugins in the `plugins` group in your Gemfile or manually require
        them in a Vagrantfile.
      bundler_error: |-
        Bundler, the underlying system Vagrant uses to install plugins,
        reported an error. The error is shown below. These errors are usually
        caused by misconfigured plugin installations or transient network
        issues. The error from Bundler is:

        %{message}
      capability_host_explicit_not_detected: |-
        The explicit capability host specified of '%{value}' could not be
        found.

        This is an internal error that users should never see. Please report
        a bug.
      capability_host_not_detected: |-
        The capability host could not be detected. This is an internal error
        that users should never see. Please report a bug.
      capability_invalid: |-
        The capability '%{cap}' is invalid. This is an internal error that
        users should never see. Please report a bug.
      capability_not_found: |-
        The capability '%{cap}' could not be found. This is an internal error
        that users should never see. Please report a bug.

      cfengine_bootstrap_failed: |-
        Failed to bootstrap CFEngine. Please see the output above to
        see what went wrong and address the issue.
      cfengine_cant_autodetect_ip: |-
        Vagrant was unable to automatically detect the IP address of the
        running machine to use as the policy server address. Please specify
        the policy server address manually, or verify that the networks are
        configured properly internally.
      cfengine_install_failed: |-
        After installing CFEngine, Vagrant still can't detect a proper
        CFEngine installation. Please verify that CFEngine was properly
        installed, as the installation may have failed.
      cfengine_not_installed: |-
        CFEngine appears not to be installed on the guest machine. Vagrant
        can attempt to install CFEngine for you if you set the "install"
        setting to "true", but this setting was not set. Please install
        CFEngine on the guest machine or enable the "install" setting for
        Vagrant to attempt to install it for you.
      cli_invalid_options: |-
        An invalid option was specified. The help for this command
        is available below.

        %{help}
      cli_invalid_usage: |-
        This command was not invoked properly. The help for this command is
        available below.

        %{help}
      command_unavailable: |-
        The executable '%{file}' Vagrant is trying to run was not
        found in the PATH variable. This is an error. Please verify
        this software is installed and on the path.
      command_unavailable_windows: |-
        The executable '%{file}' Vagrant is trying to run was not
        found in the %PATH% variable. This is an error. Please verify
        this software is installed and on the path.
      communicator_not_found: |-
        The requested communicator '%{comm}' could not be found.
        Please verify the name is correct and try again.
      config_invalid: |-
        There are errors in the configuration of this machine. Please fix
        the following errors and try again:

        %{errors}
      config_upgrade_errors: |-
        Because there were errors upgrading your Vagrantfiles, Vagrant
        can no longer continue. Please fix the errors above and try again.
      copy_private_key_failed: |-
        Vagrant failed to copy the default insecure private key into your
        home directory. This is usually caused by a permissions error.
        Please make sure the permissions of the source is readable and
        the destination is writable.

        Source: %{source}
        Destination: %{destination}
      corrupt_machine_index: |-
        The machine index which stores all required information about
        running Vagrant environments has become corrupt. This is usually
        caused by external tampering of the Vagrant data folder.

        Vagrant cannot manage any Vagrant environments if the index is
        corrupt. Please attempt to manually correct it. If you are unable
        to manually correct it, then remove the data file at the path below.
        This will leave all existing Vagrant environments "orphaned" and
        they'll have to be destroyed manually.

        Path: %{path}
      destroy_requires_force: |-
        Destroy doesn't have a TTY to ask for confirmation. Please pass the
        `--force` flag to force a destroy, otherwise attach a TTY so that
        the destroy can be confirmed.
      dotfile_upgrade_json_error: |-
        A Vagrant 1.0.x local state file was found. Vagrant is able to upgrade
        this to the latest format automatically, however various checks are
        put in place to verify data isn't incorrectly deleted. In this case,
        the old state file was not valid JSON. Vagrant 1.0.x would store state
        as valid JSON, meaning that this file was probably tampered with or
        manually edited. Vagrant's auto-upgrade process cannot continue in this
        case.

        In most cases, this can be resolve by simply removing the state file.
        Note however though that if Vagrant was previously managing virtual
        machines, they may be left in an "orphan" state. That is, if they are
        running or exist, they'll have to manually be removed.

        If you're unsure what to do, ask the Vagrant mailing list or contact
        support.

        State file path: %{state_file}
      downloader_error: |-
        An error occurred while downloading the remote file. The error
        message, if any, is reproduced below. Please fix this error and try
        again.

        %{message}
      downloader_interrupted: |-
        The download was interrupted by an external signal. It did not
        complete.
      environment_locked: |-
        Vagrant attempted to acquire a lock named '%{name}', but this
        lock is being held by another instance of Vagrant already. Please
        wait and try again.
      environment_non_existent_cwd: |-
        The working directory for Vagrant doesn't exist! This is the
        specified working directory:

        %{cwd}
      forward_port_adapter_not_found: |-
        The adapter to attach a forwarded port to was not found. Please
        verify that the given adapter is setup on the machine as a NAT
        interface.

        Host port: %{host}
        Guest port: %{guest}
        Adapter: %{adapter}
      freebsd_nfs_whitespace: |-
        FreeBSD hosts do not support sharing directories with whitespace in
        their path. Please adjust your path accordingly.
      guest_capability_invalid: |-
        The registered guest capability '%{cap}' for the
        detected guest OS '%{guest}' is invalid. The capability does
        not implement the proper method. This is a bug with Vagrant or the
        plugin that implements this capability. Please report a bug.
      guest_capability_not_found: |-
        Vagrant attempted to execute the capability '%{cap}'
        on the detect guest OS '%{guest}', but the guest doesn't
        support that capability. This capability is required for your
        configuration of Vagrant. Please either reconfigure Vagrant to
        avoid this capability or fix the issue by creating the capability.
      guest_explicit_not_detected: |-
        The guest implementation explicitly specified in your Vagrantfile
        ("%{value}") could not be found. Please verify that the plugin is
        installed which implements this guest and that the value you
        used for `config.vm.guest` is correct.
      guest_not_detected: |-
        The guest operating system of the machine could not be detected!
        Vagrant requires this knowledge to perform specific tasks such
        as mounting shared folders and configuring networks. Please add
        the ability to detect this guest operating system to Vagrant
        by creating a plugin or reporting a bug.
      home_dir_later_version: |-
        It appears that a newer version of Vagrant was run on this machine
        at some point. The current version of Vagrant is unable to read
        the configuration structure of this newer version. Please upgrade to
        the latest version of Vagrant.
      home_dir_not_accessible: |-
        The home directory you specified is not accessible. The home
        directory that Vagrant uses must be both readable and writable.

        You specified: %{home_path}
      home_dir_unknown_version: |-
        The Vagrant app data directory (%{path}) is in a
        structure Vagrant doesn't understand. This is a rare exception.
        Please report an issue or ask the mailing list for help.
      host_explicit_not_detected: |-
        The host implementation explicitly specified in your Vagrantfile
        ("%{value}") could not be found. Please verify that the plugin is
        installed which implements this host and that the value you used
        for `config.vagrant.host` is correct.
      interrupted: |-
        Vagrant exited after cleanup due to external interrupt.
      local_data_dir_not_accessible: |-
        The directory Vagrant will use to store local environment-specific
        state is not accessible. The directory specified as the local data
        directory must be both readable and writable for the user that is
        running Vagrant.

        Local data directory: %{local_data_path}
      linux_mount_failed: |-
        Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually because
        the "vboxsf" file system is not available. Please verify that
        the guest additions are properly installed in the guest and
        can work properly. The command attempted was:

        %{command}

        The error output from the last command was:

        %{output}
      linux_nfs_mount_failed: |-
        Mounting NFS shared folders failed. This is most often caused by the NFS
        client software not being installed on the guest machine. Please verify
        that the NFS client software is properly installed, and consult any resources
        specific to the linux distro you're using for more information on how to
        do this.
      linux_rdesktop_not_found: |-
        The `rdesktop` application was not found. Vagrant requires this
        in order to connect via RDP to the Vagrant environment. Please ensure
        this application is installed and available on the path and try again.
      machine_action_locked: |-
        An action '%{action}' was attempted on the machine '%{name}',
        but another process is already executing an action on the machine.
        Vagrant locks each machine for access by only one process at a time.
        Please wait until the other Vagrant process finishes modifying this
        machine, then try again.

        If you believe this message is in error, please check the process
        listing for any "ruby" or "vagrant" processes and kill them. Then
        try again.
      machine_guest_not_ready: |-
        Guest-specific operations were attempted on a machine that is not
        ready for guest communication. This should not happen and a bug
        should be reported.
      machine_locked: |-
        Vagrant can't use the requested machine because it is locked! This
        means that another Vagrant process is currently reading or modifying
        the machine. Please wait for that Vagrant process to end and try
        again. Details about the machine are shown below:

        Name: %{name}
        Provider: %{provider}
      machine_not_found: |-
        The machine with the name '%{name}' was not found configured for
        this Vagrant environment.
      machine_state_invalid: |-
        An internal error has occurred! The provider of the machine you're
        trying to work with reported an invalid state. This is a bug with
        the provider you're using, and not with Vagrant itself or with
        any configuration you may have done. Please report this bug to
        the proper location.
      multi_vm_target_required: |-
        This command requires a specific VM name to target in a multi-VM environment.
      net_ssh_exception: |-
        An error occurred in the underlying SSH library that Vagrant uses.
        The error message is shown below. In many cases, errors from this
        library are caused by ssh-agent issues. Try disabling your SSH
        agent or removing some keys and try again.

        If the problem persists, please report a bug to the net-ssh project.

        %{message}
      nfs_bad_exports: |-
        NFS is reporting that your exports file is invalid. Vagrant does
        this check before making any changes to the file. Please correct
        the issues below and execute "vagrant reload":

        %{output}
      nfs_cant_read_exports: |-
        Vagrant can't read your current NFS exports! The exports file should be
        readable by any user. This is usually caused by invalid permissions
        on your NFS exports file. Please fix them and try again.
      nfs_no_guest_ip: |-
        No guest IP was given to the Vagrant core NFS helper. This is an
        internal error that should be reported as a bug.
      nfs_no_host_ip: |-
        No host IP was given to the Vagrant core NFS helper. This is
        an internal error that should be reported as a bug.
      nfs_no_hostonly_network: |-
        NFS requires a host-only network to be created.
        Please add a host-only network to the machine (with either DHCP or a
        static IP) for NFS to work.
      nfs_no_valid_ids: |-
        No valid IDs were given to the NFS synced folder implementation to
        prune. This is an internal bug with Vagrant and an issue should be
        filed.
      nfs_not_supported: |-
        It appears your machine doesn't support NFS, or there is not an
        adapter to enable NFS on this machine for Vagrant. Please verify
        that `nfsd` is installed on your machine, and try again. If you're
        on Windows, NFS isn't supported. If the problem persists, please
        contact Vagrant support.
      nfs_client_not_installed_in_guest: |-
        No NFS client was detected as installed in your guest machine. This
        is required for NFS synced folders to work. In addition to this, Vagrant
        doesn't know how to automatically install NFS for your machine, so
        you must do this manually.

        If this message is erroneous, you may disable this check by setting
        `config.nfs.verify_installed` to `false` in your Vagrantfile.
      no_default_provider: |-
        No usable default provider could be found for your system.

        Vagrant relies on interactions with 3rd party systems, known as
        "providers", to provide Vagrant with resources to run development
        environments. Examples are VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V.

        The easiest solution to this message is to install VirtualBox, which
        is available for free on all major platforms.

        If you believe you already have a provider available, make sure it
        is properly installed and configured. You can see more details about
        why a particular provider isn't working by forcing usage with
        `vagrant up --provider=PROVIDER`, which should give you a more specific
        error message for that particular provider.
      no_default_synced_folder_impl: |-
        No synced folder implementation is available for your synced folders!
        Please consult the documentation to learn why this may be the case.
        You may force a synced folder implementation by specifying a "type:"
        option for the synced folders. Available synced folder implementations
        are listed below.

        %{types}
      no_env: |-
        A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this
        command. Run `vagrant init` to create a new Vagrant environment. Or,
        get an ID of a target machine from `vagrant global-status` to run
        this command on. A final option is to change to a directory with a
        Vagrantfile and to try again.
      plugin_gem_not_found: |-
        The plugin '%{name}' could not be installed because it could not
        be found. Please double check the name and try again.
      plugin_install_license_not_found: |-
        The license file to install could not be found. Please verify
        the path you gave is correct. The path to the license file given
        was: '%{path}'
      plugin_install_space: |-
        The directory where plugins are installed (the Vagrant home directory)
        has a space in it. On Windows, there is a bug in Ruby when compiling
        plugins into directories with spaces. Please move your Vagrant home
        directory to a path without spaces and try again.
      plugin_install_version_conflict: |-
        The plugin(s) can't be installed due to the version conflicts below.
        This means that the plugins depend on a library version that conflicts
        with other plugins or Vagrant itself, creating an impossible situation
        where Vagrant wouldn't be able to load the plugins.

        You can fix the issue by either removing a conflicting plugin or
        by contacting a plugin author to see if they can address the conflict.

        %{conflicts}
      plugin_load_error: |-
        The plugins failed to load properly. The error message given is
        shown below.

      plugin_not_installed: |-
        The plugin '%{name}' is not installed. Please install it first.
      plugin_state_file_not_parsable: |-
        Failed to parse the state file "%{path}":
        %{message}

        Please remove the file and reinstall the plugins.
        If this error recurs, please report a bug.
      plugin_uninstall_system: |-
        The plugin you're attempting to uninstall ('%{name}') is a
        system plugin. This means that the plugin is part of the installation
        of Vagrant. These plugins cannot be removed.

        You can however, install a plugin with the same name to replace
        these plugins. User-installed plugins take priority over
        system-installed plugins.
      pushes_not_defined: |-
        The Vagrantfile does not define any 'push' strategies. In order to use
        `vagrant push`, you must define at least one push strategy:

            config.push.define "ftp" do |push|
              # ... push-specific options
            end
      push_strategy_not_defined: |-
        The push strategy '%{name}' is not defined in the Vagrantfile. Defined
        strategy names are:

            %{pushes}
      push_strategy_not_loaded: |-
        There are no push strategies named '%{name}'. Please make sure you
        spelled it correctly. If you are using an external push strategy, you
        may need to install a plugin. Loaded push strategies are:

            %{pushes}
      push_strategy_not_provided: |-
        The Vagrantfile defines more than one 'push' strategy. Please specify a
        strategy. Defined strategy names are:

            %{pushes}
      package_include_symlink: |-
        A file or directory you're attempting to include with your packaged
        box has symlinks in it. Vagrant cannot include symlinks in the
        resulting package. Please remove the symlinks and try again.
      provider_not_found: |-
        The provider '%{provider}' could not be found, but was requested to
        back the machine '%{machine}'. Please use a provider that exists.
      provider_not_usable: |-
        The provider '%{provider}' that was requested to back the machine
        '%{machine}' is reporting that it isn't usable on this system. The
        reason is shown below:

        %{message}
      provisioner_flag_invalid: |-
        '%{name}' is not a known provisioner. Please specify a valid
        provisioner.
      provisioner_winrm_unsupported: |-
        The provisioner '%{name}' doesn't support provisioning on
        Windows guests via WinRM. This is likely not a limitation
        of the provisioner itself but rather that Vagrant doesn't know
        how to run this provisioner over WinRM.

        If you'd like this provisioner to work over WinRM, please
        take a look at the Vagrant source code linked below and try
        to contribute back support. Thank you!

      rsync_error: |-
        There was an error when attempting to rsync a synced folder.
        Please inspect the error message below for more info.

        Host path: %{hostpath}
        Guest path: %{guestpath}
        Command: %{command}
        Error: %{stderr}
      rsync_not_found: |-
        "rsync" could not be found on your PATH. Make sure that rsync
        is properly installed on your system and available on the PATH.
      rsync_not_installed_in_guest: |-
        "rsync" was not detected as installed in your guest machine. This
        is required for rsync synced folders to work. In addition to this,
        Vagrant doesn't know how to automatically install rsync for your
        machine, so you must do this manually.
      scp_permission_denied: |-
        Failed to upload a file to the guest VM via SCP due to a permissions
        error. This is normally because the SSH user doesn't have permission
        to write to the destination location. Alternately, the user running
        Vagrant on the host machine may not have permission to read the file.

        Source: %{from}
        Dest: %{to}
      scp_unavailable: |-
        SSH server on the guest doesn't support SCP. Please install the necessary
        software to enable SCP on your guest operating system.
      shared_folder_create_failed: |-
        Failed to create the following shared folder on the host system. This is
        usually because Vagrant does not have sufficient permissions to create
        the folder.

        %{path}

        Please create the folder manually or specify another path to share.
      shell_expand_failed: |-
        Vagrant failed to determine the shell expansion of a guest path
        (probably for one of your shared folders). This is an extremely rare
        error case and most likely indicates an unusual configuration of the
        guest system. Please report a bug with your Vagrantfile and debug log.
      ssh_authentication_failed: |-
        SSH authentication failed! This is typically caused by the public/private
        keypair for the SSH user not being properly set on the guest VM. Please
        verify that the guest VM is setup with the proper public key, and that
        the private key path for Vagrant is setup properly as well.
      ssh_bad_exit_status: |-
        The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
        Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

        %{command}

        Stdout from the command:

        %{stdout}

        Stderr from the command:

        %{stderr}
      ssh_bad_exit_status_muted: |-
        The SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status. Vagrant
        assumes that this means the command failed. The output for this command
        should be in the log above. Please read the output to determine what
        went wrong.
      ssh_channel_open_fail: |-
        Failed to open an SSH channel on the remote end! This typically
        means that the maximum number of active sessions was hit on the
        SSH server. Please configure your remote SSH server to resolve
        this issue.
      ssh_connect_eacces: |-
        SSH is getting permission denied errors when attempting to connect
        to the IP for SSH. This is usually caused by network rules and not being
        able to connect to the specified IP. Please try changing the IP on
        which the guest machine binds to for SSH.
      ssh_connection_refused: |-
        SSH connection was refused! This usually happens if the VM failed to
        boot properly. Some steps to try to fix this: First, try reloading your
        VM with `vagrant reload`, since a simple restart sometimes fixes things.
        If that doesn't work, destroy your VM and recreate it with a `vagrant destroy`
        followed by a `vagrant up`. If that doesn't work, contact a Vagrant
        maintainer (support channels listed on the website) for more assistance.
      ssh_connection_reset: |-
        SSH connection was reset! This usually happens when the machine is
        taking too long to reboot. First, try reloading your machine with
        `vagrant reload`, since a simple restart sometimes fixes things.
        If that doesn't work, destroy your machine and recreate it with
        a `vagrant destroy` followed by a `vagrant up`. If that doesn't work,
        contact support.
      ssh_connection_timeout: |-
        Vagrant timed out while attempting to connect via SSH. This usually
        means that the VM booted, but there are issues with the SSH configuration
        or network connectivity issues. Please try to `vagrant reload` or
        `vagrant up` again.
      ssh_disconnected: |-
        The SSH connection was unexpectedly closed by the remote end. This
        usually indicates that SSH within the guest machine was unable to
        properly start up. Please boot the VM in GUI mode to check whether
        it is booting properly.
      ssh_no_route: |-
        While attempting to connect with SSH, a "no route to host" (EHOSTUNREACH)
        error was received. Please verify your network settings are correct
        and try again.
      ssh_host_down: |-
        While attempting to connect with SSH, a "host is down" (EHOSTDOWN)
        error was received. Please verify your SSH settings are correct
        and try again.
      ssh_invalid_shell: |-
        The configured shell (config.ssh.shell) is invalid and unable
        to properly execute commands. The most common cause for this is
        using a shell that is unavailable on the system. Please verify
        you're using the full path to the shell and that the shell is
        executable by the SSH user.
      ssh_insert_key_unsupported: |-
        Vagrant is configured to generate a random keypair and insert it
        onto the guest machine, but it appears Vagrant doesn't know how to do
        this with your guest OS. Please disable key insertion by setting
        `config.ssh.insert_key = false` in the Vagrantfile.

        After doing so, run `vagrant reload` for the setting to take effect.

        If you'd like Vagrant to learn how to insert keys on this OS, please
        open an issue with details about your environment.
      ssh_is_putty_link: |-
        The `ssh` executable found in the PATH is a PuTTY Link SSH client.
        Vagrant is only compatible with OpenSSH SSH clients. Please install
        an OpenSSH SSH client or manually SSH in using your existing client
        using the information below.

        Host: %{host}
        Port: %{port}
        Username: %{username}
        Private key: %{key_path}
      ssh_key_bad_owner: |-
        The private key to connect to the machine via SSH must be owned
        by the user running Vagrant. This is a strict requirement from
        SSH itself. Please fix the following key to be owned by the user
        running Vagrant:

        %{key_path}
      ssh_key_bad_permissions: |-
        The private key to connect to this box via SSH has invalid permissions
        set on it. The permissions of the private key should be set to 0600, otherwise SSH will
        ignore the key. Vagrant tried to do this automatically for you but failed. Please set the
        permissions on the following file to 0600 and then try running this command again:

        %{key_path}

        Note that this error occurs after Vagrant automatically tries to
        do this for you. The likely cause of this error is a lack of filesystem
        permissions or even filesystem functionality. For example, if your
        Vagrant data is on a USB stick, a common case is that chmod is
        not supported. The key will need to be moved to a filesystem that
        supports chmod.
      ssh_key_type_not_supported: |-
        The private key you're attempting to use with this Vagrant box uses
        an unsupported encryption type. The SSH library Vagrant uses does not support
        this key type. Please use `ssh-rsa` or `ssh-dss` instead. Note that
        sometimes keys in your ssh-agent can interfere with this as well,
        so verify the keys are valid there in addition to standard
        file paths.
      ssh_not_ready: |-
        The provider for this Vagrant-managed machine is reporting that it
        is not yet ready for SSH. Depending on your provider this can carry
        different meanings. Make sure your machine is created and running and
        try again. Additionally, check the output of `vagrant status` to verify
        that the machine is in the state that you expect. If you continue to
        get this error message, please view the documentation for the provider
        you're using.
      ssh_run_requires_keys: |-
        Using `vagrant ssh -c` requires key-based SSH authentication, but your
        Vagrant environment is configured to use only password-based authentication.
        Please configure your Vagrantfile with a private key to use this
        feature.

        Note that Vagrant can automatically insert a keypair and use that
        keypair for you. Just set `config.ssh.insert_key = true` in your
        Vagrantfile.
      ssh_unavailable: "`ssh` binary could not be found. Is an SSH client installed?"
      ssh_unavailable_windows: |-
        `ssh` executable not found in any directories in the %PATH% variable. Is an
        SSH client installed? Try installing Cygwin, MinGW or Git, all of which
        contain an SSH client. Or use your favorite SSH client with the following
        authentication information shown below:

        Host: %{host}
        Port: %{port}
        Username: %{username}
        Private key: %{key_path}
      synced_folder_unusable: |-
        The synced folder type '%{type}' is reporting as unusable for
        your current setup. Please verify you have all the proper
        prerequisites for using this shared folder type and try again.
      ui_expects_tty: |-
        Vagrant is attempting to interface with the UI in a way that requires
        a TTY. Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration
        switches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant
        with TTY.
      unimplemented_provider_action: |-
        Vagrant attempted to call the action '%{action}' on the provider
        '%{provider}', but this provider doesn't support this action. This
        is probably a bug in either the provider or the plugin calling this
        action, and should be reported.
      vagrantfile_exists: |-
        `Vagrantfile` already exists in this directory. Remove it before
        running `vagrant init`.
      vagrantfile_load_error: |-
        There was an error loading a Vagrantfile. The file being loaded
        and the error message are shown below. This is usually caused by
        a syntax error.

        Path: %{path}
        Line number: %{line}
        Message: %{exception_class}: %{message}
      vagrantfile_syntax_error: |-
        There is a syntax error in the following Vagrantfile. The syntax error
        message is reproduced below for convenience:

        %{file}
      vagrantfile_write_error: |-
        The user that is running Vagrant doesn't have the proper permissions
        to write a Vagrantfile to the specified location. Please ensure that
        you call `vagrant init` in a location where the proper permissions
        are in place to create a Vagrantfile.
      vagrant_version_bad: |-
        This Vagrant environment has specified that it requires the Vagrant
        version to satisfy the following version requirements:

          %{requirements}

        You are running Vagrant %{version}, which does not satisfy
        these requirements. Please change your Vagrant version or update
        the Vagrantfile to allow this Vagrant version. However, be warned
        that if the Vagrantfile has specified another version, it probably has
        good reason to do so, and changing that may cause the environment to
        not function properly.
      vboxmanage_error: |-
        There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant
        for controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.

        Command: %{command}

        Stderr: %{stderr}
      vboxmanage_launch_error: |-
        There was an error running VBoxManage. This is usually a permissions
        problem or installation problem with VirtualBox itself, and not Vagrant.
        Please note the error message below (if any), resolve the issue, and
        try Vagrant again.

        %{message}
      vboxmanage_not_found_error: |-
        The "VBoxManage" command or one of its dependencies could not
        be found. Please verify VirtualBox is properly installed. You can verify
        everything is okay by running "VBoxManage --version" and verifying
        that the VirtualBox version is outputted.

        If you're on Windows and just installed VirtualBox, you have to
        log out and log back in for the new environmental variables to take
        effect. If you're on Linux or Mac, verify your PATH contains the folder
        that has VBoxManage in it.
      virtualbox_broken_version_040214: |-
        Vagrant detected you have VirtualBox 4.2.14 installed. VirtualBox
        4.2.14 contains a critical bug which prevents it from working with
        Vagrant. VirtualBox 4.2.16+ fixes this problem. Please upgrade
        VirtualBox.
      virtualbox_guest_property_not_found: |-
        Could not find a required VirtualBox guest property:
          %{guest_property}
        This is an internal error that should be reported as a bug.
      virtualbox_invalid_version: |-
        Vagrant has detected that you have a version of VirtualBox installed
        that is not supported. Please install one of the supported versions
        listed below to use Vagrant:

        %{supported_versions}
      virtualbox_kernel_module_not_loaded: |-
        VirtualBox is complaining that the kernel module is not loaded. Please
        run `VBoxManage --version` or open the VirtualBox GUI to see the error
        message which should contain instructions on how to fix this error.
      virtualbox_install_incomplete: |-
        VirtualBox is complaining that the installation is incomplete. Please
        run `VBoxManage --version` to see the error message which should contain
        instructions on how to fix this error.
      virtualbox_name_exists: |-
        The name of your virtual machine couldn't be set because VirtualBox
        is reporting another VM with that name already exists. Most of the
        time, this is because of an error with VirtualBox not cleaning up
        properly. To fix this, verify that no VMs with that name do exist
        (by opening the VirtualBox GUI). If they don't, then look at the
        folder in the error message from VirtualBox below and remove it
        if there isn't any information you need in there.

        VirtualBox error:

        %{stderr}
      virtualbox_no_name: |-
        Vagrant was unable to determine the recommended name for your
        VirtualBox VM. This is usually an issue with VirtualBox. The output
        from VirtualBox is shown below, which may contain an error to fix.
        The best way to fix this issue is usually to uninstall VirtualBox,
        restart your computer, then reinstall VirtualBox.

        VirtualBox output:

        %{output}
      virtualbox_no_room_for_high_level_network: |-
        There is no available slots on the VirtualBox VM for the configured
        high-level network interfaces. "private_network" and "public_network"
        network configurations consume a single network adapter slot on the
        VirtualBox VM. VirtualBox limits the number of slots to 8, and it
        appears that every slot is in use. Please lower the number of used
        network adapters.
      virtualbox_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant could not detect VirtualBox! Make sure VirtualBox is properly installed.
        Vagrant uses the `VBoxManage` binary that ships with VirtualBox, and requires
        this to be available on the PATH. If VirtualBox is installed, please find the
        `VBoxManage` binary and add it to the PATH environmental variable.
      virtualbox_user_mismatch: |-
        The VirtualBox VM was created with a user that doesn't match the
        current user running Vagrant. VirtualBox requires that the same user
        be used to manage the VM that was created. Please re-run Vagrant with
        that user. This is not a Vagrant issue.

        The UID used to create the VM was: %{original_uid}
        Your UID is: %{uid}
      virtualbox_version_empty: |-
        Vagrant detected that VirtualBox appears installed on your system,
        but calls to detect the version are returning empty. This is often
        indicative of installation issues with VirtualBox. Please verify
        that VirtualBox is properly installed. As a final verification,
        please run the following command manually and verify a version is
        outputted:

        %{vboxmanage} --version
      vm_creation_required: |-
        VM must be created before running this command. Run `vagrant up` first.
      vm_inaccessible: |-
        Your VM has become "inaccessible." Unfortunately, this is a critical error
        with VirtualBox that Vagrant can not cleanly recover from. Please open VirtualBox
        and clear out your inaccessible virtual machines or find a way to fix
        them.
      vm_name_exists: |-
        A VirtualBox machine with the name '%{name}' already exists.
        Please use another name or delete the machine with the existing
        name, and try again.
      vm_no_match: |-
        No virtual machines matched the regular expression given.
      vm_not_found: |-
        A VM by the name of %{name} was not found.
      vm_not_running: |-
        VM must be running to open SSH connection. Run `vagrant up`
        to start the virtual machine.

          The VM is in an aborted state. This means that it was abruptly
          stopped without properly closing the session. Run `vagrant up`
          to resume this virtual machine. If any problems persist, you may
          have to destroy and restart the virtual machine.
        gurumeditation: |-
          The VM is in the "guru meditation" state. This is a rare case which means
          that an internal error in VitualBox caused the VM to fail. This is always
          the sign of a bug in VirtualBox. You can try to bring your VM back online
          with a `vagrant up`.
        inaccessible: |-
          The VM is inaccessible! This is a rare case which means that VirtualBox
          can't find your VM configuration. This usually happens when upgrading
          VirtualBox, moving to a new computer, etc. Please consult VirtualBox
          for how to handle this issue.

          The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
          create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
          default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
          then the machine is not created for that environment.
        paused: |-
          The VM is paused. This VM may have been paused via the VirtualBox
          GUI or the VBoxManage command line interface. To unpause, please
          use the VirtualBox GUI and/or VBoxManage command line interface so
          that vagrant would be able to control the VM again.
        poweroff: |-
          The VM is powered off. To restart the VM, simply run `vagrant up`
        stopping: |-
          The VM is stopping.
        running: |-
          The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
          shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
          suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
          simply run `vagrant up`.
        saving: |-
          The VM is currently saving its state. In a few moments this state
          should transition to "saved." Please run `vagrant status` again
          in a few seconds.
        saved: |-
          To resume this VM, simply run `vagrant up`.
        stuck: |-
          The VM is "stuck!" This is a very rare state which means that
          VirtualBox is unable to recover the current state of the VM.
          The only known solution to this problem is to restart your
          machine, sorry.

        forward_ports:
          auto_empty: |-
            Vagrant found a port collision for the specified port and virtual machine.
            While this port was marked to be auto-corrected, the ports in the
            auto-correction range are all also used.

            VM: %{vm_name}
            Forwarded port: %{guest_port} => %{host_port}
          collision_error: |-
            Vagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they
            would collide with some other application that is already listening
            on these ports. The forwarded port to %{host_port} is already in use
            on the host machine.

            To fix this, modify your current projects Vagrantfile to use another
            port. Example, where '1234' would be replaced by a unique host port:

              config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: %{guest_port}, host: 1234

            Sometimes, Vagrant will attempt to auto-correct this for you. In this
            case, Vagrant was unable to. This is usually because the guest machine
            is in a state which doesn't allow modifying port forwarding.
