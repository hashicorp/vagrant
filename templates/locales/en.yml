      config_upgrade_messages: |-
        There were warnings and/or errors while loading your Vagrantfile.
        Your Vagrantfile was written for an earlier version of Vagrant,
        and while Vagrant does the best it can to remain backwards
        compatible, there are some cases where things have changed
        significantly enough to warrant a message. These messages are
        shown below.

        %{output}
      moving_home_dir: "Moving old Vagrant home directory to new location: %{directory}"
      home_dir_migration_failed: |-
        Both an old and new Vagrant home directory exist. Only the new one will
        be used. Please merge the old directory into the new directory if you'd
        like to use the old data as well.

        Old: %{old}
        New: %{new}
      in_bundler: |-
        You appear to be running Vagrant in a Bundler environment. Because
        Vagrant should be run within installers (outside of Bundler), Vagrant
        will assume that you're developing plugins and will change its behavior
        in certain ways to better assist plugin development.
      not_in_installer: |-
        You appear to be running Vagrant outside of the official installers.
        Note that the installers are what ensure that Vagrant has all required
        dependencies, and Vagrant assumes that these dependencies exist. By
        running outside of the installer environment, Vagrant may not function
        properly. To remove this warning, install Vagrant using one of the
        official packages from vagrantup.com.
      upgraded_v1_dotfile: |-
        A Vagrant 1.0.x state file was found for this environment. Vagrant has
        gone ahead and auto-upgraded this to the latest format. Everything
        should continue working as normal. Beware, however, that older versions
        of Vagrant may no longer be used with this environment.

        However, in case anything went wrong, the old dotfile was backed up
        to the location below. If everything is okay, it is safe to remove
        this backup.

    errors:
      active_machine_with_different_provider: |-
        An active machine was found with a different provider. Vagrant
        currently allows each machine to be brought up with only a single
        provider at a time. A future version will remove this limitation.
        Until then, please destroy the existing machine to up with a new
        provider.

        system, and try again.

        If you haven't installed Ansible yet, please install Ansible
        on your system. Vagrant can't do this for you in a safe, automated
        way. Please see ansible.cc for more info.
      base_vm_not_found: The base VM with the name '%{name}' was not found.
      batch_multi_error: |-
        An error occurred while executing multiple actions in parallel.
        Any errors that occurred are shown below.

        %{message}
      box_config_changing_box: |-
        While loading the Vagrantfile, the provider override specified
        a new box. This box, in turn, specified a different box. This isn't
        allowed, as it could lead to infinite recursion of Vagrant configuration
        loading. Please fix this.
      box_metadata_file_not_found: |-
        The "metadata.json" file for the box '%{name}' was not found.
        Boxes require this file in order for Vagrant to determine the
        provider it was made for. If you made the box, please add a
        "metadata.json" file to it. If someone else made the box, please
        notify the box creator that the box is corrupt. Documentation for
        box file format can be found at the URL below:

        http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes/format.html
      box_not_found: Box '%{name}' could not be found.

        this version of Vagrant.
      cfengine_bootstrap_failed: |-
        Failed to bootstrap CFEngine. Please see the output above to
        see what went wrong and address the issue.
      cfengine_install_failed: |-
        After installing CFEngine, Vagrant still can't detect a proper
        CFEngine installation. Please verify that CFEngine was properly
        installed, as the installation may have failed.
      cfengine_not_installed: |-
        CFEngine appears to not be installed on the guest machine. Vagrant
        can attempt to install CFEngine for you if you set the "install"
        setting to "true", but this setting was not set. Please install
        CFEngine on the guest machine or enable the "install" setting for
        Vagrant to attempt to install it for you.
      cli_invalid_options: |-
        An invalid option was specified. The help for this command
        is available below.

      command_unavailable: |-
        The executable '%{file}' Vagrant is trying to run was not
        found in the PATH variable. This is an error. Please verify
        this software is installed and on the path.
      command_unavailable_windows: |-
        The executable '%{file}' Vagrant is trying to run was not
        found in the %PATH% variable. This is an error. Please verify
        this software is installed and on the path.
      config_invalid: |-
        There are errors in the configuration of this machine. Please fix
        the following errors and try again:

        %{errors}
      config_upgrade_errors: |-
        Because there were errors upgrading your Vagrantfiles, Vagrant
        can no longer continue. Please fix the errors above and try again.
      copy_private_key_failed: |-
        Vagrant failed to copy the default insecure private key into your
        home directory. This is usually caused by a permissions error.
        Please make sure the permissions of the source is readable and
        the destination is writable.

        Source: %{source}
        Destination: %{destination}
      destroy_requires_force: |-
        Destroy doesn't have a TTY to ask for confirmation. Please pass the
        `--force` flag to force a destroy, otherwise attach a TTY so that
        the destroy can be confirmed.
      dotfile_is_directory: |-
        The local file Vagrant uses to store data ".vagrant" already exists
        and is a directory! If you are in your home directory, then please run
        this command in another directory. If you aren't in a home directory,
        then please rename ".vagrant" to something else, or configure Vagrant
        to use another filename by modifying `config.vagrant.dotfile_name`.
      dotfile_upgrade_json_error: |-
        A Vagrant 1.0.x local state file was found. Vagrant is able to upgrade
        this to the latest format automatically, however various checks are
        put in place to verify data isn't incorrectly deleted. In this case,
        the old state file was not valid JSON. Vagrant 1.0.x would store state
        as valid JSON, meaning that this file was probably tampered with or
        manually edited. Vagrant's auto-upgrade process cannot continue in this
        case.

        In most cases, this can be resolve by simply removing the state file.
        Note however though that if Vagrant was previously managing virtual
        machines, they may be left in an "orphan" state. That is, if they are
        running or exist, they'll have to manually be removed.

        If you're unsure what to do, ask the Vagrant mailing list or contact
        support.

        State file path: %{state_file}
      downloader_error: |-
        An error occurred while downloading the remote file. The error
        message, if any, is reproduced below. Please fix this error and try
        again.

        %{message}
      downloader_interrupted: |-
        The download was interrupted by an external signal. It did not
        complete.
      environment_locked: |-
        An instance of Vagrant is already running. Only one instance of Vagrant
        may run at any given time to avoid problems with VirtualBox inconsistencies
        occurring. Please wait for the other instance of Vagrant to end and then
        try again.
      forward_port_adapter_not_found: |-
        The adapter to attach a forwarded port to was not found. Please
        verify that the given adapter is setup on the machine as a NAT
        interface.

        Host port: %{host}
        Guest port: %{guest}
        Adapter: %{adapter}
      gem_command_in_bundler: |-
        You cannot run the `vagrant plugin` command while in a bundler environment.
        This should generally never happen unless Vagrant is installed outside
        of the official installers or another gem is wrongly attempting to
        use Vagrant internals directly. Please properly install Vagrant to
        fix this. If this error persists, please contact support.
      guest_capability_invalid: |-
        The registered guest capability '%{cap}' for the
        detected guest OS '%{guest}' is invalid. The capability does
        not implement the proper method. This is a bug with Vagrant or the
        plugin that implements this capability. Please report a bug.
      guest_capability_not_found: |-
        Vagrant attempted to execute the capability '%{cap}'
        on the detect guest OS '%{guest}', but the guest doesn't
        support that capability. This capability is required for your
        configuration of Vagrant. Please either reconfigure Vagrant to
        avoid this capability or fix the issue by creating the capability.
      guest_not_detected: |-
        The guest operating system of the machine could not be detected!
        Vagrant requires this knowledge to perform specific tasks such
        as mounting shared folders and configuring networks. Please add
        the ability to detect this guest operating system to Vagrant
        by creating a plugin or reporting a bug.
      home_dir_not_accessible: |-
        The home directory you specified is not accessible. The home
        directory that Vagrant uses must be both readable and writable.

        You specified: %{home_path}
      interrupted: |-
        Vagrant exited after cleanup due to external interrupt.
      local_data_dir_not_accessible: |-
        The directory Vagrant will use to store local environment-specific
        state is not accessible. The directory specified as the local data
        directory must be both readable and writable for the user that is
        running Vagrant.

        Local data directory: %{local_data_path}
      linux_mount_failed: |-
        Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually beacuse
        the "vboxsf" file system is not available. Please verify that
        the guest additions are properly installed in the guest and
        can work properly. The command attempted was:

        %{command}
      linux_nfs_mount_failed: |-
        Mounting NFS shared folders failed. This is most often caused by the NFS
        client software not being installed on the guest machine. Please verify
        that the NFS client software is properly installed, and consult any resources
        specific to the linux distro you're using for more information on how to
        do this.
      linux_shell_expand_failed: |-
        Vagrant failed to determine the shell expansion of the guest path
        for one of your shared folders. This is an extremely rare error case
        and most likely indicates an unusual configuration of the guest system.
        Please report a bug with your Vagrantfile.
      machine_guest_not_ready: |-
        Guest-specific operations were attempted on a machine that is not
        ready for guest communication. This should not happen and a bug
        should be reported.
      machine_not_found: |-
        The machine with the name '%{name}' was not found configured for
        this Vagrant environment.
      machine_state_invalid: |-
        An internal error has occurred! The provider of the machine you're
        trying to work with reported an invalid state. This is a bug with
        the provider you're using, and not with Vagrant itself or with
        any configuration you may have done. Please report this bug to
        the proper location.
      multi_vm_required: |-
        A multi-vm environment is required for name specification to this command.
      multi_vm_target_required: |-
        This command requires a specific VM name to target in a multi-VM environment.
      nfs_no_guest_ip: |-
        No guest IP was given to the Vagrant core NFS helper. This is an
        internal error that should be reported as a bug.
      nfs_no_host_ip: |-
        No host IP was given to the Vagrant core NFS helper. This is
        an internal error that should be reported as a bug.
      nfs_no_hostonly_network: |-
        NFS requires a host-only network with a static IP to be created.
        Please add a host-only network with a static IP to the machine
        for NFS to work.
      no_env: |-
        A Vagrant environment is required to run this command. Run `vagrant init`
        to set one up in this directory, or change to a directory with a
        Vagrantfile and try again.
      plugin_gem_error: |-
        An error occurred within RubyGems, the underlying system used to
        manage Vagrant plugins. The output of the errors are shown below:

        %{output}
      plugin_install_bad_entry_point: |-
        Attempting to load the plugin '%{name}' failed, because
        the entry point doesn't exist. The entry point attempted was
        '%{entry_point}'. If this is not correct, please manually
        specify an `--entry-point` when installing the plugin.
      plugin_install_license_not_found: |-
        The license file to install could not be found. Please verify
        the path you gave is correct. The path to the license file given
        was: '%{path}'
      plugin_install_not_found: |-
        The plugin '%{name}' could not be found in local or remote
        repositories. Please check the name of the plugin and try again.
      plugin_load_error: |-
        The plugin "%{plugin}" could not be found. Please make sure that it is
        properly installed via `vagrant plugin`. Note that plugins made for
        Vagrant 1.0.x are not compatible with 1.1+ and this error will likely
        continue to show when you use `plugin install` with a 1.0.x plugin.
      plugin_load_failed: |-
        Failed to load the "%{plugin}" plugin. View logs for more details.
      plugin_load_failed_with_output: |-
        Failed to load the "%{plugin}" plugin. The output from loading
        the plugin is shown below. View the logs for complete details.

        stdout: %{stdout}

        stderr: %{stderr}
      plugin_not_found: |-
        The plugin '%{name}' could not be found. Please install this plugin
        prior to attempting to do anything with it.
      port_collision_resume: |-
        This VM cannot be resumed, because the forwarded ports would collide
        with a running program (it could be another virtual machine). Normally,
        Vagrant will attempt to fix this for you but VirtualBox only allows
        forwarded ports to change if the VM is powered off. Therefore, please
        reload your VM or stop the other program to continue.
      provider_not_found: |-
        The provider '%{provider}' could not be found, but was requested to
        back the machine '%{machine}'. Please use a provider that exists.
      scp_permission_denied: |-
        Failed to upload a file to the guest VM via SCP due to a permissions
        error. This is normally because the user running Vagrant doesn't have
        read permission on the file. Please set proper permissions on the file:

        %{path}
      scp_unavailable: |-
        SSH server on the guest doesn't support SCP. Please install the necessary
        software to enable SCP on your guest operating system.
      shared_folder_create_failed: |-
        Failed to create the following shared folder on the host system. This is
        usually because Vagrant does not have sufficient permissions to create
        the folder.

        %{path}

        Please create the folder manually or specify another path to share.
      ssh_authentication_failed: |-
        SSH authentication failed! This is typically caused by the public/private
        keypair for the SSH user not being properly set on the guest VM. Please
        verify that the guest VM is setup with the proper public key, and that
        the private key path for Vagrant is setup properly as well.
      ssh_bad_exit_status: |-
        The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
        Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

        %{command}
      ssh_connect_eacces: |-
        SSH is getting permission denied errors when attempting to connect
        to the IP for SSH. This is usually caused by network rules and not being
        able to connect to the specified IP. Please try changing the IP on
        which the guest machine binds to for SSH.
      ssh_connection_refused: |-
        SSH connection was refused! This usually happens if the VM failed to
        boot properly. Some steps to try to fix this: First, try reloading your
        VM with `vagrant reload`, since a simple restart sometimes fixes things.
        If that doesn't work, destroy your VM and recreate it with a `vagrant destroy`
        followed by a `vagrant up`. If that doesn't work, contact a Vagrant
        maintainer (support channels listed on the website) for more assistance.
      ssh_connection_reset: |-
        SSH connection was reset! This usually happens when the machine is
        taking too long to reboot. First, try reloading your machine with
        `vagrant reload`, since a simple restart sometimes fixes things.
        If that doesn't work, destroy your machine and recreate it with
        a `vagrant destroy` followed by a `1vagrant up`. If that doesn't work,
        contact support.
      ssh_connection_timeout: |-
        Vagrant timed out while attempting to connect via SSH. This usually
        means that the VM booted, but there are issues with the SSH configuration
        or network connectivity issues. Please try to `vagrant reload` or
        `vagrant up` again.
      ssh_disconnected: |-
        The SSH connection was unexpectedly closed by the remote end. This
        usually indicates that SSH within the guest machine was unable to
        properly start up. Please boot the VM in GUI mode to check whether
        it is booting properly.
      ssh_no_route: |-
        While attempting to connect with SSH, a "no route to host" (EHOSTUNREACH)
        error was received. Please verify your network settings are correct
        and try again.
      ssh_host_down: |-
        While attempting to connect with SSH, a "host is down" (EHOSTDOWN)
        error was received. Please verify your SSH settings are correct
        and try again.
      ssh_is_putty_link: |-
        The `ssh` executable found in the PATH is a PuTTY Link SSH client.
        Vagrant is only compatible with OpenSSH SSH clients. Please install
        an OpenSSH SSH client or manually SSH in using your existing client
        using the information below.

        Host: %{host}
        Port: %{port}
        Username: %{username}
        Private key: %{key_path}
      ssh_key_bad_owner: |-
        The private key to connect to the machine via SSH must be owned
        by the user running Vagrant. This is a strict requirement from
        SSH itself. Please fix the following key to be owned by the user
        running Vagrant:

        %{key_path}
      ssh_key_bad_permissions: |-
        The private key to connect to this box via SSH has invalid permissions
        set on it. The permissions of the private key should be set to 0600, otherwise SSH will
        ignore the key. Vagrant tried to do this automatically for you but failed. Please set the
        permissions on the following file to 0600 and then try running this command again:

        %{key_path}
      ssh_key_type_not_supported: |-
        The private key you're attempting to use with this Vagrant box uses
        an unsupported encryption type. The SSH library Vagrant uses does not support
        this key type. Please use `ssh-rsa` or `ssh-dss` instead. Note that
        sometimes keys in your ssh-agent can interfere with this as well,
        so verify the keys are valid there in addition to standard

      ssh_not_ready: |-
        The provider for this Vagrant-managed machine is reporting that it
        is not yet ready for SSH. Depending on your provider this can carry
        different meanings. Make sure your machine is created and running and
        try again. Additionally, check the output of `vagrant status` to verify
        that the machine is in the state that you expect. If you continue to
        get this error message, please view the documentation for the provider
        you're using.
      ssh_port_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant couldn't determine the SSH port for your VM! Vagrant attempts to
        automatically find a forwarded port that matches your `config.ssh.guest_port`
        (default: 22) value and uses this for SSH. Alternatively, if `config.ssh.port`
        is set, it will use this.

        However, in this case Vagrant was unable to find a forwarded port that matches
        the guest port and `config.ssh.port` is not set!

        Please make sure that you have a forwarded port that goes to the configured
        guest port value, or specify an explicit SSH port with `config.ssh.port`.
      ssh_unavailable: "`ssh` binary could not be found. Is an SSH client installed?"
      ssh_unavailable_windows: |-
        `ssh` executable not found in any directories in the %PATH% variable. Is an
        SSH client installed? Try installing Cygwin, MinGW or Git, all of which
        contain an SSH client. Or use the PuTTY SSH client with the following
        authentication information shown below:

        Host: %{host}
        Port: %{port}
        Username: %{username}
        Private key: %{key_path}
      ui_expects_tty: |-
        Vagrant is attempting to interface with the UI in a way that requires
        a TTY. Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration
        switches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant
        with TTY.
      unimplemented_provider_action: |-
        Vagrant attempted to call the action '%{action}' on the provider
        '%{provider}', but this provider doesn't support this action. This
        is probably a bug in either the provider or the plugin calling this
        action, and should be reported.
      vagrantfile_exists: |-
        `Vagrantfile` already exists in this directory. Remove it before
        running `vagrant init`.
      vagrantfile_load_error: |-
        There was an error loading a Vagrantfile. The file being loaded
        and the error message are shown below. This is usually caused by
        a syntax error.

        Path: %{path}

      vboxmanage_error: |-
        There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant
        for controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.

        Command: %{command}

        Stderr: %{stderr}
      vboxmanage_not_found_error: |-
        The "VBoxManage" command or one of its dependencies could not
        be found. Please verify VirtualBox is properly installed. You can verify
        everything is okay by running "VBoxManage --version" and verifying
        that the VirtualBox version is outputted.
      virtualbox_invalid_version: |-
        Vagrant has detected that you have a version of VirtualBox installed
        that is not supported. Please install one of the supported versions
        listed below to use Vagrant:

        %{supported_versions}
      virtualbox_kernel_module_not_loaded: |-
        VirtualBox is complaining that the kernel module is not loaded. Please
        run `VBoxManage --version` or open the VirtualBox GUI to see the error
        message which should contain instructions on how to fix this error.
      virtualbox_install_incomplete: |-
        VirtualBox is complaining that the installation is incomplete. Please
        run `VBoxManage --version` to see the error message which should contain
        instructions on how to fix this error.
      virtualbox_no_room_for_high_level_network: |-
        There is no available slots on the VirtualBox VM for the configured
        high-level network interfaces. "private_network" and "public_network"
        network configurations consume a single network adapter slot on the
        VirtualBox VM. VirtualBox limits the number of slots to 8, and it
        appears that every slot is in use. Please lower the number of used
        network adapters.
      virtualbox_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant could not detect VirtualBox! Make sure VirtualBox is properly installed.
        Vagrant uses the `VBoxManage` binary that ships with VirtualBox, and requires
        this to be available on the PATH. If VirtualBox is installed, please find the
        `VBoxManage` binary and add it to the PATH environmental variable.
      vm_creation_required: |-
        VM must be created before running this command. Run `vagrant up` first.
      vm_inaccessible: |-
        Your VM has become "inaccessible." Unfortunately, this is a critical error
        with VirtualBox that Vagrant can not cleanly recover from. Please open VirtualBox
        and clear out your inaccessible virtual machines or find a way to fix
        them.
      vm_name_exists: |-
        A VirtualBox machine with the name '%{name}' already exists.
        Please use another name or delete the machine with the existing
        name, and try again.
      vm_no_match: |-
        No virtual machines matched the regular expression given.
      vm_not_found: |-
        A VM by the name of %{name} was not found.
      vm_not_running: |-
        VM must be running to open SSH connection. Run `vagrant up`
        to start the virtual machine.

          The VM is in an aborted state. This means that it was abruptly
          stopped without properly closing the session. Run `vagrant up`
          to resume this virtual machine. If any problems persist, you may
          have to destroy and restart the virtual machine.
        gurumeditation: |-
          The VM is in the "guru meditation" state. This is a rare case which means
          that an internal error in VitualBox caused the VM to fail. This is always
          the sign of a bug in VirtualBox. You can try to bring your VM back online
          with a `vagrant up`.
        inaccessible: |-
          The VM is inaccessible! This is a rare case which means that VirtualBox
          can't find your VM configuration. This usually happens when upgrading
          VirtualBox, moving to a new computer, etc. Please consult VirtualBox
          for how to handle this issue.

          The VM is paused. This VM may have been paused via the VirtualBox
          GUI or the VBoxManage command line interface. To unpause, please
          use the VirtualBox GUI and/or VBoxManage command line interface so
          that vagrant would be able to control the VM again.

          The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
          shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
          suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
          simply run `vagrant up`.

        saved: |-
          To resume this VM, simply run `vagrant up`.
        stuck: |-
          The VM is "stuck!" This is a very rare state which means that
          VirtualBox is unable to recover the current state of the VM.

            Vagrant found a port collision for the specified port and virtual machine.
            While this port was marked to be auto-corrected, the ports in the

            VM: %{vm_name}

          collision_error: |-
            Vagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they
            would collide with some other application that is already listening
            on these ports. The forwarded port to %{host_port} is already in use
            on the host machine.

            To fix this, modify your current projects Vagrantfile to use another
            port. Example, where '1234' would be replaced by a unique host port:

              config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: %{guest_port}, host: 1234

            Sometimes, Vagrant will attempt to auto-correct this for you. In this
            case, Vagrant was unable to. This is usually because the guest machine
            is in a state which doesn't allow modifying port forwarding.

            host only network interface can have only one DHCP server. Please
            reconfigure your host only network or remove the virtual machine

          Shared folders that Chef requires are missing on the virtual machine.
          This is usually due to configuration changing after already booting the

          The `%{binary}` binary appears to not be in the PATH of the guest. This
          could be because the PATH is not properly setup or perhaps chef is not
          installed on this guest. Chef provisioning can not continue without
          chef properly installed.
        server_url_required: |-
          Chef server provisioning requires that the `config.chef.chef_server_url` be set to the

          VM with the chef server.
        server_validation_key_doesnt_exist: |-
          The validation key set for `config.chef.validation_key_path` does not exist! This
