    errors:
      base_vm_not_found: The base VM with the name '%{name}' was not found.
      box_not_found: Box '%{name}' could not be found.
      cli_missing_env: This command requires that a Vagrant environment be properly passed in as the last parameter.
      config_validation: |-
        There was a problem with the configuration of Vagrant. The error message(s)
        are printed below:

        %{messages}
      interrupted: Vagrant exited after cleanup due to external interrupt.
      multi_vm_required: A multi-vm environment is required for name specification to this command.
      multi_vm_target_required: `vagrant %{command}` requires a specific VM name to target in a multi-VM environment.
      no_env: No Vagrant environment detected. Run `vagrant init` to set one up.
      ssh_authentication_failed: |-
        SSH authentication failed! This is typically caused by the public/private
        keypair for the SSH user not being properly set on the guest VM. Please
        verify that the guest VM is setup with the proper public key, and that
        the private key path for Vagrant is setup properly as well.
      ssh_bad_exit_status: |-
        The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
        Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

        %{command}
      ssh_key_bad_permissions: |-
        The private key to connect to this box via SSH has invalid permissions
        set on it. The permissions of the private key should be set to 0600, otherwise SSH will
        ignore the key. Vagrant tried to do this automatically for you but failed. Please set the
        permissions on the following file to 0600 and then try running this command again:

        %{key_path}
      ssh_unavailable_windows: |-
        `vagrant ssh` isn't available on the Windows platform. The
        vagrant.ppk file for use with Putty is available at:

          %{key_path}.ppk

        To use this create a new Putty session for `vagrant@localhost`
        on port `%{ssh_port}`, in the Connection>SSH>Auth
        configuration section navigate to the vagrant.ppk file,
        select it, save the session for later use, and connect.

        For a more detailed guide please consult:

          http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/windows.

      system:
        invalid_class: |-
          The specified system does not inherit from `Vagrant::Systems::Base`. The
          specified system class must inherit from this class.

          The specified system class was: %{system}
        unknown_type: |-
          The specified system type is unknown: %{system}. Please change this
          to a proper value.
        unspecified: |-
          A VM system type must be specified! This is done via the `config.vm.system`
          configuration value. Please read the documentation online for more information.
      vagrantfile_syntax_error: |-
        There is a syntax error in the following Vagrantfile. The syntax error
        message is reproduced below for convenience:

        %{file}
      virtualbox_invalid_ose: |-
        Vagrant has detected you're using an OSE ("Open Source Edition") of VirtualBox.
        Vagrant currently doesn't support any of the OSE editions due to slight API
        differences. Please download the regular package from virtualbox.org and install
        to continue.
      virtualbox_invalid_version: |-
        Vagrant has detected that you have VirtualBox version %{version} installed!
        Vagrant requires that you use at least VirtualBox version 3.2. Please install
        a more recent version of VirtualBox to continue.
      virtualbox_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant could not detect VirtualBox! Make sure VirtualBox is properly installed.
        If VirtualBox is installed, it may be an incorrect version. Vagrant currently
        requires VirtualBox 3.2.x. Please install the proper version to continue.
      vm_creation_required: VM must be created before running this command. Run `vagrant up` first.
      vm_not_found: A VM by the name of %{name} was not found.

        forward_ports:
          auto_empty: |-
            Vagrant found a port collision for the specified port and virtual machine.
            While this port was marked to be auto-corrected, the ports in the
            auto-correction range are all also used.

            VM: %{vm_name}
            Forwarded port: %{name} (%{guest_port} => %{host_port})
          below_threshold_error: |-
            The host port of all forwarded ports must be above 1024. VirtualBox
            does not allow host ports to be below 1024. (Guest ports below 1024
            are fine. For example: SSH on port 22 on the guest can be forwarded
            to port 2222, but not 222).
          collision_error: |-
            Vagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they
            would collide with another VirtualBox virtual machine's forwarded
            ports! The '%{name}' forwarded port (%{host_port}) is already in use on the host
            machine.

            To fix this, modify your current projects Vagrantfile to use another
            port. Example, where '1234' would be replaced by a unique host port:

              config.vm.forward_port("%{name}", %{guest_port}, 1234)

          fixed_collision: Fixed port collision '%{name}'. Now on port %{new_port}.

          collides: |-
            The specified host network collides with a non-hostonly network!
            This will cause your specified IP to be inaccessible. Please change
            the IP or name of your host only network to not match that of

            There is currently not host class loaded.

          and implement the `prepare_host_only_network` and `enable_host_only_network`
          methods.

          Otherwise, please report your distro and how to modify network interfaces
          to the Vagrant mailing list or IRC and we'll probably be glad to add it
          to the internal systems.
