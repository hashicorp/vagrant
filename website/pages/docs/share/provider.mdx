# Custom Provider

~> **Warning: Advanced Topic!** This topic is related to
developing Vagrant plugins. If you are not interested in this or
you are just starting with Vagrant, it is safe to skip this page.

If you are developing a [custom Vagrant provider](/docs/plugins/providers),
you will need to do a tiny bit more work in order for it to work well with
Vagrant Share.

For now, this is only one step:

- `public_address` provider capability - You must implement this capability
  to return a string that is an address that can be used to access the
  guest from Vagrant. This does not need to be a globally routable address,
  it only needs to be accessible from the machine running Vagrant. If you
  cannot detect an address, return `nil`.
