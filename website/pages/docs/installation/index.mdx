# Installing Vagrant

Installing Vagrant is extremely easy. Head over to the
[Vagrant downloads page](/downloads) and get the appropriate installer or
package for your platform. Install the package using standard procedures for
your operating system.

The installer will automatically add `vagrant` to your system path
so that it is available in terminals. If it is not found, please try
logging out and logging back in to your system (this is particularly
necessary sometimes for Windows).

~> **Looking for the gem install?** Vagrant 1.0.x had the option to
be installed as a [RubyGem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems).
This installation method is no longer supported. If you have an old version
of Vagrant installed via Rubygems, please remove it prior to installing newer
versions of Vagrant.

~> **Beware of system package managers!** Some operating system
distributions include a vagrant package in their upstream package repos.
Please do not install Vagrant in this manner. Typically these packages are
missing dependencies or include very outdated versions of Vagrant. If you
install via your system's package manager, it is very likely that you will
experience issues. Please use the official installers on the downloads page.

## Running Multiple Hypervisors

Sometimes, certain hypervisors do not allow you to bring up virtual machines
if more than one hypervisor is in use. If you are lucky, you might see the following
error message come up when trying to bring up a virtual machine with Vagrant and
VirtualBox:

```text
There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant for controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.

Command: ["startvm", <ID of the VM>, "--type", "headless"]

Stderr: VBoxManage: error: VT-x is being used by another hypervisor (VERR_VMX_IN_VMX_ROOT_MODE).
VBoxManage: error: VirtualBox can't operate in VMX root mode. Please disable the KVM kernel extension, recompile your kernel and reboot
(VERR_VMX_IN_VMX_ROOT_MODE)
VBoxManage: error: Details: code NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005), component ConsoleWrap, interface IConsole
```

Other operating systems like Windows will blue screen if you attempt to bring up
a VirtualBox VM with Hyper-V enabled. Below are a couple of ways to ensure you
can use Vagrant and VirtualBox if another hypervisor is present.

### Linux, VirtualBox, and KVM

The above error message is because another hypervisor (like KVM) is in use.
We must blacklist these in order for VirtualBox to run correctly.

First find out the name of the hypervisor:

```shell-session
$ lsmod | grep kvm
kvm_intel             204800  6
kvm                   593920  1 kvm_intel
irqbypass              16384  1 kvm
```

The one we're interested in is `kvm_intel`. You might have another.

Blacklist the hypervisor (run the following as root):

```shell-session
$ echo 'blacklist kvm-intel' >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```

Restart your machine and try running vagrant again.

### Windows, VirtualBox, and Hyper-V

If you wish to use VirtualBox on Windows, you must ensure that Hyper-V is not enabled
on Windows. You can turn off the feature by running this Powershell command:

```powershell
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
```

You can also disable it by going through the Windows system settings:

- Right click on the Windows button and select ‘Apps and Features’.
- Select Turn Windows Features on or off.
- Unselect Hyper-V and click OK.

You might have to reboot your machine for the changes to take effect. More information
about Hyper-V can be read [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).
