# Machine Settings

**Config namespace: `config.vm`**

The settings within `config.vm` modify the configuration of the
machine that Vagrant manages.

## Available Settings

- `config.vm.allow_fstab_modification` (boolean) - If true, will add fstab
  entries for synced folders. If false, no modifications to fstab will be made 
  by Vagrant. Note, this may mean that folders will not be automatically mounted
  on machine reboot. Defaults to true.

- `config.vm.allow_hosts_modification` (boolean) - If false, will prevent Vagrant
  from writing to `/etc/hosts`. Defaults to true.

- `config.vm.base_mac` (string) - The MAC address to be assigned to the default
  NAT interface on the guest. _Support for this option is provider dependent._

- `config.vm.base_address` (string) - The IP address to be assigned to the default
  NAT interface on the guest. _Support for this option is provider dependent._

- `config.vm.boot_timeout` (integer) - The time in seconds that Vagrant will wait
  for the machine to boot and be accessible. By default this is 300 seconds.

- `config.vm.box` (string) - This configures what [box](/docs/boxes) the
  machine will be brought up against. The value here should be the name
  of an installed box or a shorthand name of a box in
  [HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud](/docs/vagrant-cloud).

- `config.vm.box_check_update` (boolean) - If true, Vagrant will check for updates to
  the configured box on every `vagrant up`. If an update is found, Vagrant
  will tell the user. By default this is true. Updates will only be checked
  for boxes that properly support updates (boxes from
  [HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud](/docs/vagrant-cloud)
  or some other versioned box).

- `config.vm.box_download_checksum` (string) - The checksum of the box specified by
  `config.vm.box_url`. If not specified, no checksum comparison will be done.
  If specified, Vagrant will compare the checksum of the downloaded box to
  this value and error if they do not match. Checksum checking is only done
  when Vagrant must download the box. If this is specified, then
  `config.vm.box_download_checksum_type` must also be specified.

- `config.vm.box_download_checksum_type` (string) - The type of checksum specified
  by `config.vm.box_download_checksum` (if any). Supported values are
  currently "md5", "sha1", "sha256", "sha384", and "sha512".

- `config.vm.box_download_client_cert` (string) - Path to a client certificate to
  use when downloading the box, if it is necessary. By default, no client
  certificate is used to download the box.

- `config.vm.box_download_ca_cert` (string) - Path to a CA cert bundle to use when
  downloading a box directly. By default, Vagrant will use the Mozilla CA cert
  bundle.

- `config.vm.box_download_ca_path` (string) - Path to a directory containing
  CA certificates for downloading a box directly. By default, Vagrant will
  use the Mozilla CA cert bundle.

- `config.vm.box_download_options` (map) - A map of extra download options
  to pass to the downloader. For example, a path to a key that the downloader
  should use could be specified as `{key: "<path/to/key>"}`. The keys should
  be options supported by `curl` using the unshortened form of the flag. For
  example, use `append` instead of `a`.

- `config.vm.box_download_insecure` (boolean) - If true, then SSL certificates
  from the server will not be verified. By default, if the URL is an HTTPS
  URL, then SSL certs will be verified.

- `config.vm.box_download_location_trusted` (boolean) - If true, then all HTTP redirects will be
  treated as trusted. That means credentials used for initial URL will be used for
  all subsequent redirects. By default, redirect locations are untrusted so credentials
  (if specified) used only for initial HTTP request.

- `config.vm.box_url` (string, array of strings) - The URL that the configured box can be found at.
  If `config.vm.box` is a shorthand to a box in [HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud](/docs/vagrant-cloud)
  then this value does not need to be specified. Otherwise, it should
  point to the proper place where the box can be found if it is not
  installed. This can also be an array of multiple URLs. The URLs will be tried in
  order.

  Note that any client certificates, insecure download settings, and
  so on will apply to all URLs in this list. The URLs can also be local files
  by using the `file://` scheme. For example: `file://tmp/test.box`.

- `config.vm.box_version` (string) - The version of the box to use. This defaults to
  ">= 0" (the latest version available). This can contain an arbitrary list
  of constraints, separated by commas, such as: `>= 1.0, < 1.5`. When constraints
  are given, Vagrant will use the latest available box satisfying these
  constraints.

- `config.vm.cloud_init` - Stores various [cloud_init](/docs/cloud-init) configurations
  on the machine. __Currently experimental!__ Read the documentation for more
  information on how to enable this feature.

- `config.vm.communicator` (string) - The communicator type to use to connect to the
  guest box. By default this is `"ssh"`, but should be changed to `"winrm"` for
  Windows guests.

- `config.vm.disk` - Stores various virtual [disk](/docs/disks) configurations
  on the machine. __Currently experimental!__ Read the documentation for more
  information on how to enable this feature.

- `config.vm.graceful_halt_timeout` (integer) - The time in seconds that Vagrant will
  wait for the machine to gracefully halt when `vagrant halt` is called.
  Defaults to 60 seconds.

- `config.vm.guest` (string, symbol) - The guest OS that will be running within this
  machine. This defaults to `:linux`, and Vagrant will auto-detect the
  proper distro. However, this should be changed to `:windows` for Windows guests.
  Vagrant needs to know this information to perform some guest OS-specific things
  such as mounting folders and configuring networks.

- `config.vm.hostname` (string) - The hostname the machine should have. Defaults
  to nil. If nil, Vagrant will not manage the hostname. If set to a string,
  the hostname will be set on boot. If set, Vagrant will update `/etc/hosts`
  on the guest with the configured hostname.

- `config.vm.ignore_box_vagrantfile` (boolean) - If true, Vagrant will not load the the
  settings found inside a boxes Vagrantfile, if present. Defaults to `false`.

- `config.vm.network` - Configures [networks](/docs/networking/) on
  the machine. Please see the networking page for more information.

- `config.vm.post_up_message` (string) - A message to show after `vagrant up`. This
  will be shown to the user and is useful for containing instructions
  such as how to access various components of the development environment.

- `config.vm.provider` - Configures [provider-specific configuration](/docs/providers/configuration),
  which is used to modify settings which are specific to a certain
  [provider](/docs/providers/). If the provider you are configuring
  does not exist or is not setup on the system of the person who runs
  `vagrant up`, Vagrant will ignore this configuration block. This allows
  a Vagrantfile that is configured for many providers to be shared among
  a group of people who may not have all the same providers installed.

- `config.vm.provision` - Configures [provisioners](/docs/provisioning/)
  on the machine, so that software can be automatically installed and configured
  when the machine is created. Please see the page on provisioners for more
  information on how this setting works.

- `config.vm.synced_folder` - Configures [synced folders](/docs/synced-folders/)
  on the machine, so that folders on your host machine can be synced to
  and from the guest machine. Please see the page on synced folders for
  more information on how this setting works.

- `config.vm.usable_port_range` (range) - A range of ports Vagrant can use for
  handling port collisions and such. Defaults to `2200..2250`.
