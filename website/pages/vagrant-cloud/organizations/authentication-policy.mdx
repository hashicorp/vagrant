# Set an Organization Authentication Policy

Because organization membership affords members access to potentially sensitive
resources, owners can set organization-wide authentication policy in Vagrant
Enterprise.

## Requiring Two-Factor Authentication

Organization owners can require that all organization team members use
[two-factor authentication](/docs/vagrant-cloud/users/authentication).
Those that lack two-factor authentication will be locked out of the web
interface until they enable it or leave the organization.

Visit your organization's configuration page to enable this feature. All
organization owners must have two-factor authentication enabled to require the
practice organization-wide. Note: locked-out users are still be able to interact
with Vagrant Cloud using their `ATLAS_TOKEN`.

## Disabling Two-Factor Authentication Requirement

Organization owners can disable the two-factor authentication requirement from
their organization's configuration page. Locked-out team members (those who have
not enabled two-factor authentication) will have their memberships reinstated.
