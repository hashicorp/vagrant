# Introduction to Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a
single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant
lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and
makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

If you are already familiar with the basics of Vagrant, the
[documentation](/docs) provides a better reference build for all
available features and internals.

## Why Vagrant?

Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments
built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single
consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and
your team.

To achieve its magic, Vagrant stands on the shoulders of giants. Machines
are provisioned on top of VirtualBox, VMware, AWS, or
[any other provider](/docs/providers/). Then, industry-standard
[provisioning tools](/docs/provisioning/)
such as shell scripts, Chef, or Puppet, can automatically install
and configure software on the virtual machine.

### For Developers

If you are a **developer**, Vagrant will isolate dependencies and their
configuration within a single disposable, consistent environment, without
sacrificing any of the tools you are used to working with (editors, browsers,
debuggers, etc.). Once you or someone else creates a single
[Vagrantfile](/docs/vagrantfile/), you just need to `vagrant up` and everything
is installed and configured for you to work. Other members of your team create
their development environments from the same configuration, so whether you are
working on Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows, all your team members are running code
in the same environment, against the same dependencies, all configured the same
way. Say goodbye to "works on my machine" bugs.

### For Operators

If you are an **operations engineer** or **DevOps engineer**, Vagrant gives you a disposable
environment and consistent workflow for developing and testing infrastructure
management scripts. You can quickly test things like shell scripts, Chef
cookbooks, Puppet modules, and more using local virtualization such as
VirtualBox or VMware. Then, with the _same configuration_, you can test these
scripts on remote clouds such as AWS or RackSpace with the _same workflow_.
Ditch your custom scripts to recycle EC2 instances, stop juggling SSH prompts to
various machines, and start using Vagrant to bring sanity to your life.

### For Designers

If you are a **designer**, Vagrant will automatically set everything up that is
required for that web app in order for you to focus on doing what you do best:
design. Once a developer configures Vagrant, you do not need to worry about how
to get that app running ever again. No more bothering other developers to help
you fix your environment so you can test designs. Just check out the code,
`vagrant up`, and start designing.

### For Everyone

Vagrant is designed for everyone as the easiest and fastest way to create a
virtualized environment!
