# Reseller Information

This page is intended to answer questions commonly needed by resellers. If you
are a reseller all required information should be on this page.

## Quote

Each license is a one-time cost of `$79` USD per seat. All orders must be placed
using US currency.

## Self-serve purchase

Licenses can be purchased in our [self service portal](http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware#buy-now)
with a credit card.

## Reseller Discounts

We do not offer reseller discounts. Volume pricing is available for those who
qualify.

## Volume Pricing

We offer volume pricing when purchasing 1 or more sets of 150 licenses. If you
or your organization plans to purchase 1 or more sets of 150 licenses, please
contact sales@hashicorp.com to learn more about volume discounts before making your
purchase.

## Purchase Orders

Although we prefer the self-serve purchase, for 1 or more sets of 150 licenses, we
can do PO. Please contact sales@hashicorp.com for a quote.

The following product SKU is available:

- `HCVAVDA` - Vagrant VMware Desktop Plugin

Failure to include all required information or proper product SKUs may result in
delayed processing.

You are responsible for license distribution to the end user. HashiCorp will
provide you with a downloadable license file and instructions, but it is the
reseller's responsibility to distribute to the customer.

## Seats

A single seat can be used on two computers (such as a desktop and a laptop)
for a single person. The license is valid forever with access to free
maintenance updates.

## Upgrade Pricing &amp; Eligibility

Future major updates may require an upgrade fee. Typically this upgrade fee is
\$49 USD, but that is subject to change. Customers may check their license
upgrade eligibility by visiting the
[license upgrade center](http://license.hashicorp.com/upgrade/vmware2015) and
entering the email address with which they made the purchase. For licenses
purchased by a reseller, only the reseller can request the license upgrade.

## Licenses

After a successful purchase, license files and associated installation
instructions will be generated and emailed to you.
