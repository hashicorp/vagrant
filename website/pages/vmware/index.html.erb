          The Vagrant VMware plugin licenses are valid for specific VMware
          product versions at the time of purchase. When new versions of
          VMware products are released, significant changes to the plugin code
          are often required to support this new version. For this reason, you
          may need to upgrade your current license to work with the new
          version of the VMware product. Customers can check their license
          upgrade eligibility by visiting the
          <a href="http://license.hashicorp.com/upgrade/vmware">License Upgrade Center</a>
          and entering the email address with which they made the original

          Please note: your existing license will continue to work with all

          older version.
