                The Vagrant VMware plugin licenses are valid for specific VMware
                product versions at the time of purchase. When new versions of
                VMware products are released, significant changes to the plugin
                code are often required to support this new version. For this
                reason, you may need to upgrade your current license to work
                with the new version of the VMware product. Customers can check
                their license upgrade eligibility by visiting the{' '}
