					<h2>Unparalleled Performance</h2>

					<p>
					VMware <em>screams</em>, with industry-leading performance<sup>1</sup>

					<h2>Rock Solid Stability</h2>

					<p>
					The VMware hypervisor has been in production use since 1999.
					All their products share the same, robust core that powers
					the world's largest organizations. With the VMware provider, Vagrant
					now runs on the strength of the same foundation.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="span6">
					<h2>Uncompromised Portability</h2>

					<p>
					VMware virtual machines run on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.
					Vagrant provides support for both VMware Fusion (Mac OS X) and
					VMware Workstation (Linux and Windows), which are able to run
					the same virtual machines across multiple platforms.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="span6">
					<h2>Professional Support</h2>

					<p>
					Every purchase of the Vagrant VMware provider comes with
					direct email support. VMware products themselves are eligible for
					professional support from VMware. Someone always has your back
					in case things aren't working as well as they should be.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="span6">
					<h2>&hearts; Open Source</h2>

					<p>
					Vagrant is free and open source. While the VMware providers
					are not, the revenue is used to continue to develop, support,
					and grow Vagrant and the community around it.

						<strong>I already own a license, am I eligible for an upgrade?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Existing license holders may check their upgrade eligibility by
						visiting <a href="http://license.hashicorp.com/upgrade/vmware2015">the license upgrade center</a>.
						If you are eligible for an upgrade, the system will generate a
						unique discount code that may be used when purchasing the new

					<p>
						<strong>Do I need to pay for upgrades to my license?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The Vagrant VMware plugin licenses are valid for specific VMware
						product versions at the time of purchase. When new versions of
						VMware products are released, significant changes to the plugin code
						are often required to support this new version. For this reason, you
						may need to upgrade your current license to work with the new
						version of the VMware product. Customers can check their license
						upgrade eligibility by visiting the
						<a href="http://license.hashicorp.com/upgrade/vmware2015">License Upgrade Center</a>
						and entering the email address with which they made the original
						purchase.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please note: your existing license will continue to work with all
						previous versions of the VMware products. If you do not wish to
						update at this time, you can rollback your VMware installation to an
						older version.

						The <a href="/vmware/eula.html">EULA for the Vagrant VMware plugins</a>
						is available on the Vagrant website.

						We certainly do! <a href="mailto:support@hashicorp.com?subject=Bulk Discounts">Email support</a>
						with the number of licenses you need and we can give you bulk pricing

						<strong>Since each license comes with two "seats", can I use one seat for the Vagrant VMware Fusion plugin and one seat for the Vagrant VMware Workstation plugin?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Unfortunately this is not possible at this time. The Vagrant VMware
						Fusion plugin and the Vagrant VMware Workstation plugin are separate
						products and cannot be shared in this manner. We apologize for the
						inconvenience.
					</p>
					<p>
						We do offer a 50% discount off the purchase of the other Vagrant

						<strong>I accidentally bought the wrong Vagrant VMware plugin, can I switch?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Sure! Even though the Vagrant VMware Fusion plugin and the Vagrant
						VMware Workstation plugin are different products, they are the same
						price and fall under the same EULA. As such, we can transfer the
						license for you. Please <a href="mailto:support@hashicorp.com?subject=Transfer License">contact support</a>
						for assistance. Be sure to include your original order number. You
						may be asked to confirm details your purchase to verify the

						<strong>Does this include the VMware software?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The Vagrant VMware Plugin requires the separate purchase of VMware
						Fusion/Workstation from VMware. The VMware product is not bundled
						with the plugin.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="span8 offset2">
					<p>
						<strong>Why is the Vagrant VMware plugin not working with my trial version of VMware Fusion/Workstation?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						While we have not been able to isolate to a specific issue or cause,
						the Vagrant VMware Fusion and Vagrant VMware Workstation plugins are
						sometimes incompatible with the trial versions of the VMware
						products.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please try restarting your computer and running the VMware software
						manually. Occassionally you must accept the license agreement before
						VMware will run. If you do not see any errors when opening the
						VMware GUI, you may need to purchase the full version to use the
						plugin. We apologize for the inconvenience.

			<div class="row">
				<div class="span8 offset2">
					<p>
						<strong>Can I use VMware Workstation Player?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>Some</em> features of the Vagrant VMware Workstation plugin will
						work with VMware Player, but it is not officially supported.

				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="span8 offset2">
					<p>
						<strong>Do I need VMware Fusion/Workstation Pro or just the regular version?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The Vagrant VMware plugin is compatible with both the regular and
						Pro versions of VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation. However, some
						advanced features (such as linked clones), are only supported by the
						Pro versions of the VMware software.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please consult the VMware documentation to determine which features
						are supported by the Pro and non-Pro versions to determine which
						product you need to purchase.
