Welcome to the official Vagrant blog. This blog will be used to announce
new releases, highlight Vagrant features, showcase specific Vagrant use-cases,
and more.

We invite any members of the Vagrant community to submit blog posts
by creating a [pull request on the Vagrant GitHub repository](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant).
You can find all the blog posts in `website/www/source/blog`. The
`website/www` directory has a README file explaining how to run the
site locally.

We're looking for submissions on anything and everything related to Vagrant.
It can be as general as how to use a certain feature of Vagrant, or as
specific as how to use Vagrant to develop a certain application or in
a certain language.

Please subscribe [to the RSS feed](https://feeds.feedburner.com/vagrantup).
We look forward to shipping blog posts shortly!
