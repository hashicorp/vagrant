        <p>
          The VMware hypervisor has been in production use since 1999.
          All their products share the same, robust core that powers
          the world's largest organizations. With the VMware provider, Vagrant
          now runs on the strength of the same foundation.

        <h3>Uncompromised Portability</h3>
        <p>
          VMware virtual machines run on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.
          Vagrant provides support for both VMware Fusion (Mac OS X) and
          VMware Workstation (Linux and Windows), which are able to run
          the same virtual machines across multiple platforms.

          Every purchase of the Vagrant VMware provider comes with
          direct email support. VMware products themselves are eligible for
          professional support from VMware. Someone always has your back
          in case things are not working as well as they should be.

          Vagrant is free and open source. While the VMware providers
          are not, the revenue is used to continue to develop, support,
          and grow Vagrant and the community around it.

          We offer an academic discount of 10% for the Vagrant VMware plugins.
          However, we require proof that you are a current student or employee
          in academia. Please contact support with <strong>any one</strong> of

        <h3>Do I need to pay for upgrades to my license?</h3>
        <p>
          The Vagrant VMware plugin licenses are valid for specific VMware
          product versions at the time of purchase. When new versions of
          VMware products are released, significant changes to the plugin code
          are often required to support this new version. For this reason, you
          may need to upgrade your current license to work with the new
          version of the VMware product. Customers can check their license
          upgrade eligibility by visiting the
          <a href="http://license.hashicorp.com/upgrade/vmware">License Upgrade Center</a>
          and entering the email address with which they made the original
          purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note: your existing license will continue to work with all
          previous versions of the VMware products. If you do not wish to
          update at this time, you can rollback your VMware installation to an
          older version.

        <h3>Does this include the VMware software?</h3>
        <p>
          The Vagrant VMware Plugin requires the separate purchase of VMware
          Fusion/Workstation from VMware. The VMware product is not bundled
          with the plugin.

        <h3>Why is the Vagrant VMware plugin not working with my trial version of VMware Fusion/Workstation?</h3>
        <p>
          While we have not been able to isolate to a specific issue or cause,
          the Vagrant VMware Fusion and Vagrant VMware Workstation plugins are
          sometimes incompatible with the trial versions of the VMware
          products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please try restarting your computer and running the VMware software
          manually. Occasionally you must accept the license agreement before
          VMware will run. If you do not see any errors when opening the
          VMware GUI, you may need to purchase the full version to use the
          plugin. We apologize for the inconvenience.

        <h3>Can I use VMware Workstation Player?</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Some</em> features of the Vagrant VMware Workstation plugin will
          work with VMware Player, but it is not officially supported. Vagrant
          interacts with VMware via the VMware API, and some versions of
          VMware Workstation Player do not support those APIs. When in doubt,
          please purchase VMware Workstation Pro to use all the features
          supported by the integration.

        <h3>Do I need VMware Fusion/Workstation Pro or just the regular version?</h3>
        <p>
          The Vagrant VMware plugin is compatible with both the regular and
          Pro versions of VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation. However, some
          advanced features (such as linked clones), are only supported by the
          Pro versions of the VMware software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please consult the VMware documentation to determine which features
          are supported by the Pro and non-Pro versions to determine which
          product you need to purchase.
