          All their products share the same, robust core that powers
          the world's largest organizations. With the VMware provider, Vagrant
          now runs on the strength of the same foundation.

          Vagrant provides support for both VMware Fusion (Mac OS X) and
          VMware Workstation (Linux and Windows), which are able to run
          the same virtual machines across multiple platforms.

          <p>
            The Vagrant VMware plugin licenses are valid for specific VMware
            product versions at the time of purchase. When new versions of
            VMware products are released, significant changes to the plugin code
            are often required to support this new version. For this reason, you
            may need to upgrade your current license to work with the new
            version of the VMware product. Customers can check their license
            upgrade eligibility by visiting the
            <a href="http://license.hashicorp.com/upgrade/vmware2015">License Upgrade Center</a>
            and entering the email address with which they made the original
            purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note: your existing license will continue to work with all
            previous versions of the VMware products. If you do not wish to
            update at this time, you can rollback your VMware installation to an
            older version.
