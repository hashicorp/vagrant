# VirtualBox

Vagrant comes with support out of the box for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org),
a free, cross-platform consumer virtualization product.

The VirtualBox provider is compatible with VirtualBox versions 4.0.x, 4.1.x,
4.2.x, 4.3.x, 5.0.x, 5.1.x, and 5.2.x. Other versions are unsupported and the provider
will display an error message. Please note that beta and pre-release versions
of VirtualBox are not supported and may not be well-behaved.

VirtualBox must be installed on its own prior to using the provider, or
the provider will display an error message asking you to install it.
VirtualBox can be installed by [downloading](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
a package or installer for your operating system and using standard procedures
to install that package.

Use the navigation to the left to find a specific VirtualBox topic to read more about.
