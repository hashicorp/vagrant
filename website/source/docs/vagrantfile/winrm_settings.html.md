# WinRM Settings

**Config namespace: `config.winrm`**

The settings within `config.winrm` relate to configuring how Vagrant
will access your Windows guest over WinRM. As with most Vagrant settings, the
defaults are typically fine, but you can fine tune whatever you would like.

These settings are only used if you've set your communicator type to `:winrm`.

## Available Settings

`config.winrm.username` - This sets the username that Vagrant will use
to login to the WinRM web service by default. Providers are free to override
this if they detect a more appropriate user. By default this is "vagrant,"
since that is what most public boxes are made as.

<hr>

`config.winrm.password` - This sets a password that Vagrant will use to
authenticate the WinRM user. By default this is "vagrant," since that is
what most public boxes are made as.

<hr>

`config.winrm.host` - The hostname or IP to connect to the WinRM service.
By default this is empty, because the provider usually figures this out for
you.

<hr>

`config.winrm.port` - The WinRM port to connect to, by default 5985.

<hr>

`config.winrm.guest_port` - The port on the guest that WinRM is running on.
This is used by some providers to detect forwarded ports for WinRM. For
example, if this is set to 5985 (the default), and Vagrant detects a forwarded
port to port 5985 on the guest from port 4567 on the host, Vagrant will attempt
to use port 4567 to talk to the guest if there is no other option.

<hr>

`config.winrm.execution_time_limit` - The maximum duration that a WinRM
task can execute for. This defaults to two hours. The format of this value
must be in this [Microsoft-documented format](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa382678.aspx).

<hr>

<strong>Warning:</strong> In order for Vagrant to communicate with a Windows
guest, you must allow unencrypted WinRM connections on the guest machine
itself. Some public boxes already have this configured, but if you are
attempting to `vagrant up` a Windows box and the command hangs at
`Waiting for WinRM to become available...`, then you will need to run the
commands below on the guest machine itself, at the box setup stage,
after provisioning, or through a start up script.

```
Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Service\AllowUnencrypted -Value True
Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Service\Auth\Basic -Value True
```
