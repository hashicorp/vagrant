# Docker

Vagrant comes with support out of the box for
using Docker as a provider. This allows for your development environments
to be backed by Docker containers rather than virtual machines. Additionally,
it provides for a good workflow for developing Dockerfiles.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Warning: Docker knowledge assumed.</strong> We assume that
  you know what Docker is and that you are comfortable with the basics
  of Docker. If not, we recommend starting with another provider such
  as <a href="/docs/virtualbox/">VirtualBox</a>.
