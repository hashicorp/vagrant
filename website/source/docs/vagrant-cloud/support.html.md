It's often the case that Vagrant Cloud questions or feedback relates to
the HashiCorp tooling. We encourage all Vagrant Cloud users to search for
related issues and problems in the open source repositories and mailing lists
prior to contacting us to help make our support more efficient and to help
resolve problems faster.
