# Atlas and Vagrant

Atlas is the HashiCorp Suite for the Enterprise,
but also provides features for the community. It hosts
a <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search">public registry of Vagrant boxes</a>
as well as powers the Vagrant share features.

Vagrant Enterprise is provided via Atlas and allows
for private boxes to be hosted and distributed to
your team.

## Signing up for Atlas

You can signup for a free Atlas account <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/account/new">here</a>.
