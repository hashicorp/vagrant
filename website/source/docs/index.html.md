# Vagrant Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Vagrant - the command line utility for managing
the lifecycle of virtual machines. This website aims to document every feature
of Vagrant from top-to-bottom, covering as much detail as possible. If you are
just getting started with Vagrant, it is highly recommended that you start with
the [getting started guide](/intro/getting-started/index.html) first, and then
return to this page.

The navigation will take you through each component of Vagrant. Click on a
navigation item to get started, or read more about
[why developers, designers, and operators choose Vagrant](/intro/index.html)
for their needs.
