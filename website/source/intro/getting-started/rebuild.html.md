# Rebuild

When you are ready to come back to your project, whether it is tomorrow,
a week from now, or a year from now, getting it up and running is easy:

```
$ vagrant up
```

That's it! Since the Vagrant environment is already all configured via
the Vagrantfile, you or any of your coworkers simply have to run
`vagrant up` at any time and Vagrant will recreate your work environment.

## Next Steps

You have successfully managed the full lifecycle of your Vagrant environment.
