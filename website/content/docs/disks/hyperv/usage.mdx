# Usage

For examples of how to use the disk feature with Hyper-V, please refer to the
[general disk usage guide](/vagrant/docs/disks/usage) for more examples.

## provider_config options

Most options are used for either creating or attaching a hard disk to your guest.
Vagrant supports most options for these operations. You should be able to define
the PowerShell specific argument to a given Hyper-V command in the provider_config
hash, and Vagrant should properly pass it along to the command.

To define a provider specific option, please refer to the [Disk Options documentation page](/vagrant/docs/disks/configuration) for more info.

### Note about options defined below

It is possible these options could be out of date or stale. If you happen to see
an option that has changed or is missing from this page, please open an issue
or pull request on Vagrants GitHub page to correct this.

### New-VHD Supported Options

For more information about each option, please visit the [New-VHD Hyper-V documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/hyper-v/new-vhd?view=win10-ps).

**Note:** By default, all Hyper-V disks are defined as a Dynamic virtual hard disk. If you
wish to make the disk a fixed size, you can set the `Fixed` option below when creating
a new disk.

- `BlockSizeBytes` (string) - Optional argument, i.e. `"128MB"`
- `Differencing` (bool) - If set, the disk will be used to store differencing changes from parent disk (must set `ParentPath`)
- `Fixed` (bool) - If set, the disk will be a fixed size, not dynamically allocated.
- `LogicalSectorSizeBytes` (int) - Optional argument, must be either `512` or `4096`
- `ParentPath` (string) - The parent disk path used if a `Differencing` disk is defined
- `PhysicalSectorSizeBytes` (string) - Optional argument, must be either `512` or `4096`
- `SourceDisk` (int) - Existing disk to use as a source for the new disk

### Add-VMHardDiskDrive Supported Options

For more information about each option, please visit the [Add-VMHardDiskDrive Hyper-V documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/hyper-v/add-vmharddiskdrive?view=win10-ps)

Generally, these options do not need to be set or handled by most users. Only
use these options if you are sure you know what you are doing. Vagrant will
be able to attach disks for you without these options, but they are available
if it is required that you specify a specific location for a disk.

- `ControllerLocation` (int) - The location that the disk should be attached to on the controller
- `ControllerNumber` (int) - The controller to use for attaching the disk
- `ControllerType` (string) - The kind of controller to use when attaching the a disk. Only `"IDE"` and `"SCSI"` are valid.
