# Common Issues and Troubleshooting

This page lists some common issues people run into with Vagrant and Hyper-V
as well as solutions for those issues.

## Are my disks attached?

A handy way to figure out what disks are attached (or not attached) to your guest
is to open up the Hyper-V GUI and select the guest. When selecting a guest on the GUI,
it should open more information about the guest, including storage information. Here
you should see a list of disks attached to your guest.

## Applying Vagrant disk configuration changes to guests

Due to how Hyper-V works, you must reload your guest for any disk config changes
to be applied. So if you update your Vagrantfile to update or even remove disks, make
sure to `vagrant reload` your guests for these changes to be applied.
