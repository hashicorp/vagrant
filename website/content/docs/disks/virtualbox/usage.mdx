# Usage

~> **Warning!** This feature is experimental and may break or
change in between releases. Use at your own risk. It currently is not officially
supported.

This feature currently requires the experimental flag to be used. To explicitly enable this feature, you can set the experimental flag to:

```
VAGRANT_EXPERIMENTAL="disks"
```

Please note that `VAGRANT_EXPERIMENTAL` is an environment variable. For more
information about this flag visit the [Experimental docs page](/docs/experimental/)
for more info. Without this flag enabled, any disks defined will not be configured.

For examples of how to use the disk feature with VirtualBox, please refer to the
[general disk usage guide](/docs/disks/usage) for more examples.

## provider_config options

Currently, there are no additional options supported for the `provider_config` option.
This page will be updated with any valid options as they become supported.
