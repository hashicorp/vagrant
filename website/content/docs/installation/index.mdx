# Install Vagrant

To get started with Vagrant, download the appropriate installer or
package for your platform from our
[Vagrant downloads page](/downloads). Install the package with the standard procedures for
your operating system.

The installer automatically adds `vagrant` to your system path
so that it is available in terminals. If it is not found,
log out and back into your system; this is a common issue for Windows.

~> **Rubygem installation is unsupported** Vagrant 1.0.x has the option to
be installed as a [RubyGem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems).
However, this installation method is no longer supported. If you have an old version
of Vagrant installed via Rubygems, remove it prior to installing newer
versions of Vagrant.

## First development environment

If you are new to Vagrant, the next step to set up a development environment is to install
a [box](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-boxes).

## How to use multiple hypervisors

Hypervisors often do not allow you to bring up virtual machines if you have more than one hypervisor in use.

Below are a couple of examples to allow you
to use Vagrant and VirtualBox if another hypervisor is present.

### Linux, VirtualBox, and KVM

If you encounter the following error message, it is because another hypervisor, like KVM, is in use.

```shell-session
There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant for controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.

Command: ["startvm", <ID of the VM>, "--type", "headless"]

Stderr: VBoxManage: error: VT-x is being used by another hypervisor (VERR_VMX_IN_VMX_ROOT_MODE).
VBoxManage: error: VirtualBox can't operate in VMX root mode. Please disable the KVM kernel extension, recompile your kernel and reboot
(VERR_VMX_IN_VMX_ROOT_MODE)
VBoxManage: error: Details: code NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005), component ConsoleWrap, interface IConsole
```

You must add the additional hypervisors to the deny list in order for VirtualBox to run correctly.

First, find out the name of the hypervisor.

```shell-session
$ lsmod | grep kvm
kvm_intel             204800  6
kvm                   593920  1 kvm_intel
irqbypass              16384  1 kvm
```

Use the `blacklist` command to add the hypervisor to your denylist.

```shell-session
$ echo 'blacklist kvm-intel' >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```

Restart your machine and try the `vagrant` command again.

### Windows, VirtualBox, and Hyper-V

If you encounter an issue with Windows, you will get a blue screen if you attempt to bring up
a VirtualBox VM with Hyper-V enabled. 

If you wish to use VirtualBox on Windows, you must ensure that Hyper-V is not enabled
on Windows. You can turn off the feature with the following Powershell command for Windows 10.

```powershell
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
```

For Windows 11, you can use an elevated Powershell.

```powershell
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
```

You can also disable Hyper-V in the Windows system settings.

- Right click on the Windows button and select ‘Apps and Features’.
- Select Turn Windows Features on or off.
- Unselect Hyper-V and click OK.

You might have to reboot your machine for the changes to take effect. More information
about Hyper-V can be read [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).
