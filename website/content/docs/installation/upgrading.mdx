# Upgrade Vagrant

This page details how to upgrade Vagrant in the 1.x.x series.

~> If you need to upgrade from Vagrant 1.0.x, read the
[specific page dedicated to that](/vagrant/docs/installation/upgrading-from-1-0).

Vagrant upgrades during the 1.x.x release series are straightforward:

1. [Download](/vagrant/downloads) the new package
2. Install it over the existing package

The installers will properly overwrite and remove old files. It is recommended
that no other Vagrant processes are running during the upgrade process.

## Vagrantfile compatibility with 3.0

Note that Vagrantfile stability for the new Vagrantfile syntax is not
guaranteed until Vagrant 3.0. While Vagrantfiles made for 1.0.x will
[continue to work](/vagrant/docs/installation/backwards-compatibility),
newer Vagrantfiles may have backwards incompatible changes until 3.0.

## Issue reports

If you encounter any problems at upgrade time, [report them as an issue in Github](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues). Upgrades are meant to be a smooth process and we consider it a bug if it was not.
