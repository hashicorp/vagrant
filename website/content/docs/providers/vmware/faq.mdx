# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Can Vagrant VMware Plugin work without internet?

No, Vagrant VMware plugin requires a new license every 6 weeks. Vagrant will try to renew the
license automatically. If you are on an environment without internet, after 4 weeks Vagrant will emit a warning,
and after 6 weeks, the VMware plugin will stop working. You can install a new license to reactive vagrant.

## Q: I purchased a Vagrant VMware plugin license, but I did not receive an email?

First, please check your JUNK or SPAM folders. Since the license comes from an
automated system, it might have been flagged as spam by your email provider. If
you do not see the email there, please [contact support](mailto:support@hashicorp.com?subject=License Not Received)
and include the original order number.

## Q: Do I need to keep the Vagrant VMware plugin license file on disk?

After you have installed the Vagrant VMware plugin license, it is safe to remove
your copy from disk. Vagrant copies the license into its structure for reference
on boot.

## Q: Do I need to purchase a separate license for VMware Fusion/Workstation

Yes. The Vagrant VMware desktop plugin license is only valid the for the Vagrant
plugin and cannot be used to license the VMware Fusion or VMware Workstation
application.

## Q: I lost my original email, where can I download my Vagrant VMware plugin license again?

Please [contact support](mailto:support@hashicorp.com?subject=Lost My License&body=Hello support! I seem to have misplaced my Vagrant VMware license. Could you please send it to me? Thanks!). **Note:**
please contact support using the email address with which you made the
original purchase. If you use an alternate email, you will be asked to verify
that you are the owner of the requested license.

## Q: I upgraded my VMware product and now my license is invalid?

The Vagrant VMware plugin licenses are valid for specific VMware product
versions at the time of purchase. When new versions of VMware products are
released, significant changes to the plugin code are often required to support
this new version. For this reason, you may need to upgrade your current license
to work with the new version of the VMware product. Customers can check their
license upgrade eligibility by visiting the [License Upgrade Center](https://license.hashicorp.com/upgrade/vmware)
and entering the email address with which they made the original purchase.

Your existing license will continue to work with all previous versions of the
VMware products. If you do not wish to update at this time, you can rollback
your VMware installation to an older version.

## Q: How do I upgrade my currently installed Vagrant VMware plugin?

You can update the Vagrant VMware plugin to the latest version by re-running the
install command:

```shell-session
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-desktop
```

To upgrade the Vagrant VMware utility, download the latest version from the
[Vagrant VMware utility downloads page](/vmware/downloads) and install the
system package to your local system.
