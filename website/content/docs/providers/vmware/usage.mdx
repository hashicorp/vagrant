# Usage

The Vagrant VMware provider is used just like any other provider. Please
read the general [basic usage](/docs/providers/basic_usage) page for
providers.

The value to use for the `--provider` flag is `vmware_desktop`. For compatibility
with older versions of the plugin, `vmware_fusion` can be used for VMware
Fusion, and `vmware_workstation` for VMware Workstation.

The Vagrant VMware provider does not support parallel execution at this time.
Specifying the `--parallel` option will have no effect.

To get started, create a new `Vagrantfile` that points to a VMware box:

```ruby
# vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
end
```

Then run:

```shell-session
$ vagrant up --provider vmware_desktop
```

This will download and bring up a new VMware Fusion/Workstation virtual machine
in Vagrant.
