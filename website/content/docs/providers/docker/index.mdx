# Docker

Vagrant comes with support out of the box for
using Docker as a provider. This allows for your development environments
to be backed by Docker containers rather than virtual machines. Additionally,
it provides for a good workflow for developing Dockerfiles.

~> **Warning: Docker knowledge assumed.** We assume that
you know what Docker is and that you are comfortable with the basics
of Docker. If not, we recommend starting with another provider such
as [VirtualBox](/docs/providers/virtualbox).

Use the navigation to the left to find a specific Docker topic
to read more about.
