# Parallels

The Parallels provider for Vagrant is officially supported by [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com) and 
allows managing Parallels Desktop for Mac virtual machines. 
Both Intel and Apple M1-powered Mac computers are supported. 

The Parallels provider is free and open for contributions on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels).

The Parallels provider is compatible with the latest versions of Parallels Desktop for Mac and works with
 "Pro" and "Business" editions. Please note that Parallels Desktop is a third-party product
that must be purchased and installed separately before using the provider.

Learn more about the Parallels provider installation, configuration, and boxes with the [Vagrant Parallels Provider documentation](https://parallels.github.io/vagrant-parallels/docs/).
