# Vagrant Boxes

Boxes are the package format for [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/) environments.
A box can be used on any Vagrant-supported platform to bring up an identical
working environment across a development team.

## Create and version Vagrant boxes

Boxes support versioning so that members of your team using Vagrant can update
the underlying box easily, and the people who create boxes can push fixes and
communicate these fixes efficiently.

Vagrant Cloud makes it easy to manage the versioning of boxes. Versioning boxes in
Vagrant Cloud allows for easy updates, transparent fixes, and clear communication in
changes made. Learn more about the [box release lifecycle
here](/vagrant/vagrant-cloud/boxes/lifecycle).
