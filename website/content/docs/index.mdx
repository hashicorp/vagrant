# Vagrant Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Vagrant - the command line utility for managing
the lifecycle of virtual machines. This website aims to document every feature
of Vagrant from top-to-bottom, covering as much detail as possible. If you are
just getting started with Vagrant, we highly recommended starting with
the [getting started tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vagrant) on
HashiCorp's Learn platform first, and then returning to this page.

The navigation will take you through each component of Vagrant. Click on a
navigation item to get started, or read more about
[why developers, designers, and operators choose Vagrant](/intro)
for their needs.
