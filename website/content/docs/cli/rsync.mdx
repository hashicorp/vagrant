# Rsync

**Command: `vagrant rsync`**

This command forces a re-sync of any
[rsync synced folders](/vagrant/docs/synced-folders/rsync).

Note that if you change any settings within the rsync synced folders such
as exclude paths, you will need to `vagrant reload` before this command will
pick up those changes.

## Options

- `--[no-]rsync-chown` - Use rsync to modify ownership of transferred files. Enabling
  this option can result in faster completion due to a secondary process not being
  required to update ownership. By default this is disabled.
