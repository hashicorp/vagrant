# Up

**Command: `vagrant up [name|id]`**

This command creates and configures guest machines according to your
[Vagrantfile](/vagrant/docs/vagrantfile/).

This is the single most important command in Vagrant, since it is how
any Vagrant machine is created.

## Options

- `name` - Name of machine defined in [Vagrantfile](/vagrant/docs/vagrantfile/). Using
  `name` to specify the Vagrant machine to act on must be done from within a
  Vagrant project (directory where the Vagrantfile exists).

- `id` - Machine id found with `vagrant global-status`. Using `id` allows
  you to call `vagrant up id` from any directory.

- `--[no-]destroy-on-error` - Destroy the newly created machine if a fatal,
  unexpected error occurs. This will only happen on the first `vagrant up`.
  By default this is set.

- `--[no-]install-provider` - If the requested provider is not installed,
  Vagrant will attempt to automatically install it if it can. By default this
  is enabled.

- `--[no-]parallel` - Bring multiple machines up in parallel if the provider
  supports it. Please consult the provider documentation to see if this feature
  is supported.

- `--provider x` - Bring the machine up with the given
  [provider](/vagrant/docs/providers/). By default this is "virtualbox".

- `--[no-]provision` - Force, or prevent, the provisioners to run.

- `--provision-with x,y,z` - This will only run the given provisioners. For
  example, if you have a `:shell` and `:chef_solo` provisioner and run
  `vagrant provision --provision-with shell`, only the shell provisioner will
  be run.
