# Validate

**Command: `vagrant validate`**

This command validates your [Vagrantfile](/vagrant/docs/vagrantfile/).

## Options

- `--ignore-provider` - Ignores provider config options.

## Examples

Validate the syntax of the Vagrantfile to ensure it is correctly structured and free of errors

```shell-session
$ vagrant validate
Vagrantfile validated successfully.
```

Ensure that the Vagrantfile is correctly structured while ignoring provider-specific configuration options:

```shell-session
$ vagrant validate --ignore-provider virtualbox
==> default: Ignoring provider config for validation...
Vagrantfile validated successfully.
```
