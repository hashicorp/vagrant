# Cloud

**Command: `vagrant cloud`**

This is the command used to manage anything related to [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com).

The main functionality of this command is exposed via subcommands:

- [`auth`](#cloud-auth)
- [`box`](#cloud-box)
- [`provider`](#cloud-provider)
- [`publish`](#cloud-publish)
- [`search`](#cloud-search)
- [`version`](#cloud-version)

# Cloud Auth

**Command: `vagrant cloud auth`**

The `cloud auth` command is for handling all things related to authorization with
Vagrant Cloud.

- [`login`](#cloud-auth-login)
- [`logout`](#cloud-auth-logout)
- [`whoami`](#cloud-auth-whoami)

## Cloud Auth Login

**Command: `vagrant cloud auth login`**

The login command is used to authenticate with [HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud](/vagrant-cloud)
server. Logging in is only necessary if you are accessing protected boxes.

**Logging in is not a requirement to use Vagrant.** The vast majority
of Vagrant does _not_ require a login. Only certain features such as protected
boxes.

The reference of available command-line flags to this command
is available below.

### Options

- `--check` - This will check if you are logged in. In addition to outputting
  whether you are logged in or not, the command exit status will be 0 if you are
  logged in, or 1 if you are not.

- `--logout` - This will log you out if you are logged in. If you are already
  logged out, this command will do nothing. It is not an error to call this
  command if you are already logged out.

- `--token` - This will set the Vagrant Cloud login token manually to the provided
  string. It is assumed this token is a valid Vagrant Cloud access token.

### Examples

Securely authenticate to Vagrant Cloud using a username and password:

```shell-session
$ vagrant cloud auth login
# ...
Vagrant Cloud username:
Vagrant Cloud password:
```

Check if the current user is authenticated:

```shell-session
$ vagrant cloud auth login --check
You are already logged in.
```

Securely authenticate with Vagrant Cloud using a token:

```shell-session
$ vagrant cloud auth login --token ABCD1234
The token was successfully saved.
```

## Cloud Auth Logout

**Command: `vagrant cloud auth logout`**

This will log you out if you are logged in. If you are already
logged out, this command will do nothing. It is not an error to call this
command if you are already logged out.

## Cloud Auth Whoami

**Command: `vagrant cloud auth whoami [TOKEN]`**

This command will validate your Vagrant Cloud token and will print the user who
it belongs to. If a token is passed in, it will attempt to validate it instead
of the token stored stored on disk.

# Cloud Box

The `cloud box` command is used to manage life cycle operations for all `box`
entities on Vagrant Cloud.

- `--private` - Will make the new box private (Public by default)

## Cloud Box Delete

**Command: `vagrant cloud box delete ORGANIZATION/BOX-NAME`**

The box delete command will _permanently_ delete the given box entry on Vagrant Cloud. Before
making the request, it will ask if you are sure you want to delete the box.

## Cloud Provider Create

**Command: `vagrant cloud provider create ORGANIZATION/BOX-NAME PROVIDER-NAME VERSION [URL]`**

The provider create command is used to create a new provider entry on Vagrant Cloud.
The `url` argument is expected to be a remote URL that Vagrant Cloud can use
to download the provider. If no `url` is specified, the provider entry can be updated
later with a url or the [upload](#cloud-provider-upload) command can be used to
upload a Vagrant [box file](/docs/boxes).

the specified version and provider.

# Cloud Publish

The publish command is a complete solution for creating and updating a
Vagrant box on Vagrant Cloud. Instead of having to create each attribute of a Vagrant

the information required before creating or updating a new box.
