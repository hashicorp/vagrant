# Basic Usage

Below are some very simple examples of how to use Vagrant Triggers.

## Examples

The following is a basic example of two global triggers. One that runs _before_
the `:up` command and one that runs _after_ the `:up` command:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.trigger.before :up do |trigger|
    trigger.name = "Hello world"
    trigger.info = "I am running before vagrant up!!"
  end

  config.trigger.after :up do |trigger|
    trigger.name = "Hello world"
    trigger.info = "I am running after vagrant up!!"
  end

  config.vm.define "ubuntu" do |ubuntu|
    ubuntu.vm.box = "ubuntu"
  end
end
```

These will run before and after each defined guest in the Vagrantfile.

Running a remote script to save a database on your host before **destroy**ing a
guest:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.define "ubuntu" do |ubuntu|
    ubuntu.vm.box = "ubuntu"

    ubuntu.trigger.before :destroy do |trigger|
      trigger.warn = "Dumping database to /vagrant/outfile"
      trigger.run_remote = {inline: "pg_dump dbname > /vagrant/outfile"}
    end
  end
end
```

Now that the trigger is defined, running the **destroy** command will fire off
the defined trigger before Vagrant destroys the machine.

```shell-session
$ vagrant destroy ubuntu
```

An example of defining three triggers that start and stop tinyproxy on your host
machine using homebrew:

```shell
#/bin/bash
# start-tinyproxy.sh
brew services start tinyproxy
```

```shell
#/bin/bash
# stop-tinyproxy.sh
brew services stop tinyproxy
```

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.define "ubuntu" do |ubuntu|
    ubuntu.vm.box = "ubuntu"

    ubuntu.trigger.before :up do |trigger|
      trigger.info = "Starting tinyproxy..."
      trigger.run = {path: "start-tinyproxy.sh"}
    end

    ubuntu.trigger.after :destroy, :halt do |trigger|
      trigger.info = "Stopping tinyproxy..."
      trigger.run = {path: "stop-tinyproxy.sh"}
    end
  end
end
```

Running `vagrant up` would fire the before trigger to start tinyproxy, where as
running either `vagrant destroy` or `vagrant halt` would stop tinyproxy.

### Ruby Option

Triggers can also be defined to run Ruby, rather than bash or PowerShell. An
example of this might be using a Ruby option to get more information from the `VBoxManage`
tool. In this case, we are printing the `ostype` defined for the guest after
it has been brought up.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.define "ubuntu" do |ubuntu|
    ubuntu.vm.box = "ubuntu"

    ubuntu.trigger.after :up do |trigger|
      trigger.info = "More information with ruby magic"
      trigger.ruby do |env,machine|
        puts `VBoxManage showvminfo #{machine.id} --machinereadable | grep ostype`
      end
    end
  end
end
```

If you are defining your triggers using the hash syntax, you must use the `Proc`
type for defining a ruby trigger.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.define "ubuntu" do |ubuntu|
    ubuntu.vm.box = "ubuntu"

    ubuntu.trigger.after :up,
      info: "More information with ruby magic",
      ruby: proc{|env,machine| puts `VBoxManage showvminfo #{machine.id} --machinereadable | grep ostype`}
  end
end
```

### Typed Triggers

Below are some basic examples of using `:type` triggers. They cover commands, hooks,
and actions.

It is important to note that while `command` triggers will be a fairly common use case,
both `action` and `hook` triggers are more complicated and are a more advanced use case.

#### Commands

The most common use case for typed triggers are with `command`. These kinds of
triggers allow you to run something before or after a subcommand in Vagrant.

```ruby
config.trigger.after :status, type: :command do |t|
  t.info = "Showing status of all VMs!"
end
```

Because they are specifically for subcommands, they do not work with any guest
operations like `run_remote` or if you define the trigger as a guest trigger.

#### Hooks

Below is an example of a Vagrant trigger that runs before and after each defined
provisioner:

```ruby
config.trigger.before :provisioner_run, type: :hook do |t|
  t.info = "Before the provision!"
end

config.vm.provision "file", source: "scripts/script.sh", destination: "/test/script.sh"

config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
echo "Provision the guest!"
SHELL

```

Notice how this trigger runs before _each_ provisioner defined for the guest:

```shell
==> guest: Running provisioner: Sandbox (file)...
==> vagrant: Running hook triggers before provisioner_run ...
==> vagrant: Running trigger...
==> vagrant: Before the provision!
    guest: /home/hashicorp/vagrant-sandbox/scripts/script.sh => /home/vagrant/test/script.sh
==> guest: Running provisioner: shell...
==> vagrant: Running hook triggers before provisioner_run ...
==> vagrant: Running trigger...
==> vagrant: Before the provision!
    guest: Running: inline script
    guest: Provision the guest!
```

#### Actions

With action typed triggers, you can fire off triggers before or after certain
Action classes. A simple example of this might be warning the user when Vagrant
invokes the `GracefulHalt` action.

```ruby
config.trigger.before :"Vagrant::Action::Builtin::GracefulHalt", type: :action do |t|
  t.warn = "Vagrant is halting your guest..."
end
```

#### Provision action

The provision stack works little different than the other action stacks. The Vagrant
stack is made up of middlewares that are run in a specific order. generally it tend to
to perform their operation and call to the next item but in some cases will continue to
do things once the next item completes. In the Provision action, the next item in the
stack is executed [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/main/lib/vagrant/action/builtin/provision.rb#L82-L83).but the actual provisioning happens at the end [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/main/lib/vagrant/action/builtin/provision.rb#L129-L133), after the rest of the stack
has executed and exited.


```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu"

  # Provisioners:
  config.vm.provision "PROVISIONER1", type: :shell, inline: "echo executing first provisioner"
  config.vm.provision "PROVISIONER2", type: :shell, inline: "echo executing second provisioner"

  # Triggers:

  config.trigger.before :machine_action_provision, type: :hook,
    name: "HOOK TRIGGER BEFORE machine_action_provision",
    info: "INSIDE BEFORE machine_action_provision HOOK TRIGGER"

  config.trigger.before Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Provision, type: :action,
    name: "ACTION TRIGGER BEFORE Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Provision",
    info: "INSIDE BEFORE Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Provision TRIGGER"

  config.trigger.after Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Provision, type: :action,
    name: "ACTION TRIGGER AFTER Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Provision",
    info: "INSIDE AFTER Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Provision TRIGGER"

  config.trigger.after :machine_action_provision, type: :hook,
    name: "HOOK TRIGGER AFTER machine_action_provision",
    info: "INSIDE AFTER machine_action_provision HOOK TRIGGER"

end
```

When running `vagrant provision` or `vagrant up`, the before and after triggers
will run before the provisioning of the box happens.
