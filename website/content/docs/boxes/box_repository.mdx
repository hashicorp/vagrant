# Box Repository

A Vagrant Box Repository provides Vagrant with some boxes and information
on how to get the boxes. This can exist on a local filesystem or a service
like Vagrantcloud.

There are two components that make up a Box Repository:

- Vagrant Boxes - These are Vagrant `.box` files. See the 
  [box documentation](/vagrant/docs/boxes) for more information on Vagrant boxes.

- Box Catalog Metadata - This is a JSON document (typically exchanged
  during interactions with [HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud](/vagrant/vagrant-cloud))
  that specifies the name of the box, a description, available
  versions, available providers, and URLs to the actual box files
  (next component) for each provider and version. If this catalog
  metadata does not exist, a box file can still be added directly, but
  it will not support versioning and updating.

## Box Catalog Metadata

The metadata is an optional component for a box (but highly recommended)
that enables [versioning](/vagrant//docs/boxes/versioning), updating, multiple
providers from a single file, and more.

-> **You do not need to manually make the metadata.** If you
have an account with [HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud](/vagrant/vagrant-cloud), you
can create boxes there, and HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud automatically creates
the metadata for you. The format is still documented here.

It is a JSON document, structured in the following way:

```json
{
  "name": "hashicorp/bionic64",
  "description": "This box contains Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64-bit.",
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "providers": [
        {
          "name": "virtualbox",
          "url": "http://example.com/bionic64_010_virtualbox.box",
          "checksum_type": "sha1",
          "checksum": "foo",
          "architecture": "amd64",
          "default_architecture": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the JSON document can describe multiple versions of a box,
multiple providers, and can add/remove providers/architectures in different
versions.

This JSON file can be passed directly to `vagrant box add` from the
local filesystem using a file path or via a URL, and Vagrant will
install the proper version of the box. In this case, the value for the
`url` key in the JSON can also be a file path. If multiple providers
are available, Vagrant will ask what provider you want to use.
