# Uninstall Vagrant

To uninstall Vagrant, you can either uninstall the Vagrant binary, the user data, or both. The two sections below detail how to uninstall Vagrant on any platform.

## Remove the Vagrant program

When you remove the Vagrant program, it will remove the `vagrant` binary and all dependencies from your machine. It will _not_ remove user data. The next section provides more details on how to remove that directory from your system.

### Windows machines

Uninstall using the **Add/Remove Programs** section of the control panel.

### Mac OS X machines

As a super user, force remove the directory and remove it from your path with `pkgutil`.\

```shell-session
sudo rm -rf /opt/vagrant /usr/local/bin/vagrant
sudo pkgutil --forget com.vagrant.vagrant
```

### Linux machines

As a super user, force remove the Vagrant directories.

```shell-session
rm -rf /opt/vagrant
rm -f /usr/bin/vagrant
```

## Remove user data

The removal of user data will remove all [boxes](/vagrant/docs/boxes), [plugins](/vagrant/docs/plugins), license files, and any stored state that may be used by Vagrant. Removing the user data effectively makes Vagrant think it is a fresh install.

On Linux and Mac OS platforms, the user data directory location is in the root of your home directory under `vagrant.d`. Remove the `~/.vagrant.d` directory to delete all the user data. On Windows, this directory is, `C:\Users\YourUsername\.vagrant.d`, where `YourUsername` is the username of your local user.

If the Vagrant support team asks you to remove this directory to debug, you should make a backup.

When you use Vagrant again, Vagrant will automatically regenerate any data necessary to operate.

## Reinstall Vagrant

If you decide to reinstall Vagrant, you can follow the [installation docs](/vagrant/docs/installation) again for any standard method.
