# Vagrant Go

Vagrant-go is Vagrant implemented in Go. This version of Vagrant is compatible
with Ruby based Vagrant plugins as well as Vagrantfiles. However, there are
some significant changes to how Vagrant-go works which make it NOT interchangeable
with Vagrant (Ruby).

~> **Warning!** Vagrant-go is in alpha and should be expected to be unstable.
Users are not recommended to use Vagrant-go for normal day to day operations.

## Anatomy of Vagrant-go

Vagrant-go has made significant changes in where data is stored. As a result,
machines managed with Vagrant (Ruby) can not be managed by Vagrant-go and vice versa.

### Vagrant-go binary

The Vagrant-go binary is shipped with the Vagrant installer. In order to run the Vagrant-go
binary do:

```
$ vagrant-go global-status
```

### Vagrant Ruby

Vagrant-go still depends on Vagrant-ruby being available in order to run Ruby plugins
and for parsing Vagrantfiles. So, Vagrant-go runs Vagrant-ruby as a server in a subprocess,
providing it access to all the Ruby functionality.

### Scopes

Vagrant-go has a notion of an information hierarchy. There are three main components:

**Target**: A target is the most specific component in the information hierarchy. It
represents the guest that Vagrant may manipulate. It is similar to the notion of a
Vagrant Machine.

**Project**: A project is similar to the concept of an Environment. It represents
a group of targets. A project may have plugins installed that are not available
to other projects. A project directory is any directory that has a Vagrantfile.

**Basis**: The basis is the most general component. It represents the root of the Vagrant
execution environment and may contain multiple projects. A user may define multiple basis'
for their installation. Plugins installed into the basis will be available to all projects
within the basis. Vagrantfiles setup in the basis will be applied to all projects.

### Data directories

The default Vagrant-go data directory and config directory have changed to meet the
[XDG specification](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/adrg/xdg).
The data directory is now at the XDG data home. The config directory is now at the
XDG config home. In addition, project level information is no longer available in
`PROJECT_DIR/.vagrant`. Instead, this information is available with the data and config dirs.

The form of these directories is as follows:

```
|- $XDG_CONFIG_DIR
  \- default  # basis name
    |- Vagrantfile  # a basis level Vagrantfile will be applied to all machines in the basis
    \- project
      \- project_one  # project name
        \- target
          |- target_one  # target name
          |- target_two
      \- project_two
        \- target
          |- a
          |- b
```

```
|- $XDG_DATA_DIR
  |- data.db  # Vagrant database
  \- default  # basis name
    |- insecure_private_key
    \- boxes  # box directory
       \- hashicorp-VAGRANTSLASH-bionic64  # box name
         \- 1.0.282  # box version
           \- virtualbox  # box provider
             |- Vagrantfile
             |- box.ovf
             |- metadata.json
             |- ubuntu-18.04-amd64-disk001.vmdk
    \- project
      \- project_one  # project name
        \- target
          |- target_one  # target name
          |- target_two
      \- project_two
        |- vbox_symlink_create_warning
        \- target
          |- a
          |- b


```

Vagrant-go does not have knowledge of the Vagrant-ruby data directories so does not
have access to that data and vice versa. Both Vagrant-go and Vagrant-ruby
respect the [Vagrant environment variables](/docs/other/environmental-variables/) for
setting data directory paths. However, the layout and content of these directories
are different for Vagrant-go and Vagrant-ruby.

~> **Warning!** Vagrant-go users should not attempt to use an existing `VAGRANT_HOME`
directory as it may corrupt it.


#### Boxes

Boxes still exist within the data directory. As mentioned above, the data directory is now
at `$XDG_DATA_DIR`. The ramifications of this are:
 - Boxes will be duplicated between Vagrant-go and Vagrant-ruby
 - Users can still import local boxes in both Vagrant-go and Vagrant-ruby using the
   `box add` command. So, users don't need to download boxes multiple times.

#### Machine index

The machine index for Vagrant-go is backed by the `data.db` in the data directory.
The ramifications of this are:
- Vagrant-go and Vagrant-ruby do  not share a machine index. They have no knowledge of
  each other, so machines you bring up in one will not be available in the other. There is
  currently no way to “import” or “export” a machine index entry

## Installing Go Vagrant plugins

Vagrant-go can load external plugins that are packaged as executables. Plugins can be
launched from the basis (`VAGRANT_CONFIG_DIR/plugins`) or the project directory
(`VAGRANT_PROJECT/.vagrant/plugins`).

These executables will be executed without any options or flags provided.
To install a new plugin, drop the plugin executable in one of these paths.

## Known Issues

For all Vagrant-Go issues see the public [GitHub issues](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/labels/vagrant-go)

### Vagrant ssh command does not work interactively

The `-c` argument does work to specify a single command to run. For example:
```
# Run a command on the guest machine
vagrant ssh -c "echo hello world"
```

Users may still access the Vagrant machine over SSH by running the ssh command. For example:
```
# Get the SSH configuration for the target machine
vagrant ssh-config <target>

# Use the info provided to SSH into the target machine using the ssh command
ssh vagrant@<ip> -p <port> -i <path to key>
```

### `vagrant plugin` command only manipulates Ruby plugins

The Vagrant plugin command uses bundler to manage Ruby based plugins. To install/uninstall
go based plugins, users must manually add the plugin binary to the plugins path.
Uninstalling Ruby Vagrant plugins does not currently work.

### Vagrant does not work on Windows

The go plugin setup currently is built on Unix sockets. So, Vagrant-go is not expected to
work on Windows. This will be addressed in a future release.

### Concurrent Vagrant runs don’t work

Only one Vagrant-go process may run at a time.

### Puppet and Chef provisioners do not work

These provisioners require Vagrant to modify synced folders on the fly during a Vagrant run.
This capability will not be implemented for 2.3.0, so, these provisioners will not work as
expected.

### Each machine must specify their own SSH port for multi machine environments

Currently, Vagrant-go does not check for port collisions when forwarding ports. Instead, it
will allow for multiple forwarded ports to be defined on the same host port. This results in
the SSH ports for machines to all be assigned to the same default port if none is specified.
This causes Vagrant to time out when connecting to a machine in multimachine environments. To
avoid this issue you may specify the SSH port for the machines, for example:
```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.define "one" do |c|
    c.vm.hostname = "one"
    c.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 22, host: 2223
    c.ssh.port = 2223
    c.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
    c.vm.synced_folder ".", "vagrant", disabled: true
  end

  config.vm.define "two" do |c|
    c.vm.hostname = "two"
    c.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 22, host: 2224
    c.ssh.port = 2224
    c.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
    c.vm.synced_folder ".", "vagrant", disabled: true
  end
end
```
