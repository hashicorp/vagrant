# Vagrant Settings

**Config namespace: `config.vagrant`**

The settings within `config.vagrant` modify the behavior of Vagrant
itself.

## Available Settings

- `config.vagrant.host` (string, symbol) - This sets the type of host machine
  that is running Vagrant. By default this is `:detect`, which causes Vagrant to
  auto-detect the host. Vagrant needs to know this information in order to perform
  some host-specific things, such as preparing NFS folders if they're enabled.
  You should only manually set this if auto-detection fails.

- `config.vagrant.plugins` - (string, array, hash) - Define plugin, list of
  plugins, or definition of plugins to install for the local project. Vagrant
  will require these plugins be installed and available for the project. If
  the plugins are not available, it will attempt to automatically install
  them into the local project. When requiring a single plugin, a string can
  be provided:

  ```ruby
  config.vagrant.plugins = "vagrant-plugin"
  ```

  If multiple plugins are required, they can be provided as an array:

  ```ruby
  config.vagrant.plugins = ["vagrant-plugin", "vagrant-other-plugin"]
  ```

  Plugins can also be defined as a Hash, which supports setting extra options
  for the plugins. When a Hash is used, the key is the name of the plugin, and
  the value is a Hash of options for the plugin. For example, to set an explicit
  version of a plugin to install:

  ```ruby
  config.vagrant.plugins = {"vagrant-scp" => {"version" => "1.0.0"}}
  ```

  Supported options are:

  - `entry_point` - Path for Vagrant to load plugin
  - `sources` - Custom sources for downloading plugin
  - `version` - Version constraint for plugin

- `config.vagrant.sensitive` - (string, array) - Value or list of values that
  should not be displayed in Vagrant's output. Value(s) will be removed from
  Vagrant's normal UI output as well as logger output.

  ```ruby
  config.vagrant.sensitive = ["MySecretPassword", ENV["MY_TOKEN"]]
  ```
