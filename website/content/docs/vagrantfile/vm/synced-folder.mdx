# Synced folder configuration

Synced folders are configured within your Vagrantfile using the `config.vm.synced_folder` method. The following example shows a simple synced folder configuration.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # other config here

  config.vm.synced_folder "src/", "/srv/website"
end
```

The first parameter is a path to a directory on the host machine. If the path is relative, it is relative to the project root. The second parameter must be an absolute path of where to share the folder within the guest machine. This folder will be created (recursively, if it must) if it does not exist. By default, Vagrant mounts the synced folders with the owner/group set to the SSH user and any parent folders set to root.

## Options

You may also specify additional optional parameters when configuring synced folders. These options are listed below. More detailed examples of using some of these options are shown below this section, note the owner/group example supplies two additional options separated by commas.

In addition to these options, the specific synced folder type might allow more options. Refer to the documentation for your specific synced folder
type for more details. The built-in synced folder types are documented in other pages available in the navigation for these docs.

- `create` (boolean) - If true, the host path will be created if it does not exist. Defaults to false.

- `disabled` (boolean) - If true, this synced folder will be disabled and will not be setup. This can be used to disable a previously defined synced folder or to conditionally disable a definition based on some external factor.

- `group` (string) - The group that will own the synced folder. By default this will be the SSH user. Some synced folder types do not support modifying the group.

- `mount_options` (array) - A list of additional mount options to pass to the `mount` command.

- `owner` (string) - The user who should be the owner of this synced folder. By default, this will be the SSH user. Some synced folder types do not support modifying the owner.

- `type` (string) - The type of synced folder. If this is not specified, Vagrant will automatically choose the best synced folder option for your environment. Otherwise, you can specify a specific type such as `nfs`.

- `id` (string) - The name for the mount point of this synced folder in the guest machine. This shows up when you run `mount` in the guest machine.
