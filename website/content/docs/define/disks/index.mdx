# Vagrant Disks

Vagrant Disks is a feature that allows users to define what mediums should be attached
to their guests, as well as allowing users to resize their primary disk.

For examples on how to achieve this, among other use cases, please refer to the [usage](/vagrant/docs/disks/usage)
guide for more information!

For more information about what options are available for configuring disks, see the
[configuration section](/vagrant/docs/disks/configuration).

## Supported providers

Currently, only VirtualBox is supported. Please refer to the [VirtualBox documentation](/vagrant/docs/disks/virtualbox) for more information on using disks with the VirtualBox provider!

## Examples

The following examples show how to use Vagrant Disks with the VirtualBox provider.

### Resize your primary disk

Sometimes, the primary disk for a guest is not large enough and you will need to add more space. To resize a disk, you can simply add a config like this below to expand the size of your guests drive.

```ruby
config.vm.disk :disk, size: "100GB", primary: true
```

The `primary: true` is what tells Vagrant to expand the guests main drive. Without this option, Vagrant will instead attach a _new_ disk to the guest.

The following example shows how to resize the primary disk for an Ubuntu guest. This guest will now come with 100GB of space, rather than the default.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.define "hashicorp" do |h|
    h.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
    h.vm.provider :virtualbox

    h.vm.disk :disk, size: "100GB", primary: true
  end
end
```

Due to how VirtualBox functions, it is not possible to shrink the size of a disk.

### Attaching new hard disks

Vagrant can attach multiple disks to a guest using the VirtualBox provider. The following example shows how to attach a single disk to a guest with 10 GB of storage.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.define "hashicorp" do |h|
    h.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
    h.vm.provider :virtualbox

    h.vm.disk :disk, size: "10GB", name: "extra_storage"
  end
end
```

Optionally, if you need to attach many disks, you can use Ruby to generate multiple disks for Vagrant to create and attach to your guest.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.define "hashicorp" do |h|
    h.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
    h.vm.provider :virtualbox

    (0..3).each do |i|
      h.vm.disk :disk, size: "5GB", name: "disk-#{i}"
    end
  end
end
```

VirtualBox has a hard limit on the number of disks that can be attached to a given storage controller, which is defined by the controller type. Attempting to configure more disks than are supported by the primary controller will result in a Vagrant error.

### Attach optical drives

Vagrant can attach `.iso` files as optical drives using the VirtualBox provider. The following example shows how to attach an optical drive to a guest.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.define "hashicorp" do |h|
    h.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
    h.vm.provider :virtualbox

    h.vm.disk :dvd, name: "installer", file: "./installer.iso"
  end
end
```

As with hard disks, configuring more disks than are supported by your VM's
storage controller arrangement will result in a Vagrant error.

### Remove disks

If you have removed a disk from your Vagrant config and wish for it to be detached from the guest, you will need to `vagrant reload` your guest to apply these changes. 

<Note>

Removing virtual hard disks created by Vagrant will also delete the medium from your hard drive.
