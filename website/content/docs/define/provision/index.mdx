# Provisioning

Provisioners in Vagrant allow you to automatically install software, alter configurations, and more on the machine as part of the `vagrant up` process.

This is useful since [boxes](/vagrant/docs/boxes) typically are not built _perfectly_ for your use case. Of course, if you want to just use `vagrant ssh` and install the software by hand, that works. But by using the provisioning systems built-in to Vagrant, it automates the process so that it is repeatable. Most importantly, it requires no human interaction, so you can `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up` and have a fully ready-to-go work environment with a single command. Powerful.

Vagrant gives you multiple options for provisioning the machine, from simple shell scripts to more complex, industry-standard configuration management systems.

If you've never used a configuration management system before, it is recommended you start with basic [shell scripts](/vagrant/docs/provisioning/shell) for provisioning.

You can find the full list of built-in provisioners and usage of these provisioners in the navigational area to the left.

## When provisioning happens

Provisioning happens at certain points during the lifetime of your Vagrant environment:

- On the first `vagrant up` that creates the environment, provisioning is run. If the environment was already created and the up is just resuming a machine or booting it up, they will not run unless the `--provision` flag is explicitly provided.

- When `vagrant provision` is used on a running environment.

- When `vagrant reload --provision` is called. The `--provision` flag must be present to force provisioning.

You can also bring up your environment and explicitly _not_ run provisioners by specifying `--no-provision`.

## Configure provisioners

First, every provisioner is configured within your [Vagrantfile](/vagrant/docs/vagrantfile/) using the `config.vm.provision` method call. For example, the Vagrantfile below enables shell provisioning:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # ... other configuration

  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "echo hello"
end
```

Every provisioner has a type, such as `"shell"`, used as the first parameter to the provisioning configuration. Following that is basic key/value for configuring that specific provisioner. Instead of basic key/value, you can also use a Ruby block for a syntax that is more like variable assignment. The following is effectively the same as the prior example:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # ... other configuration

  config.vm.provision "shell" do |s|
    s.inline = "echo hello"
  end
end
```

The benefit of the block-based syntax is that with more than a couple options it can greatly improve readability. Additionally, some provisioners, like the Chef provisioner, have special methods that can be called within that block to ease configuration that cannot be done with the key/value approach, or you can use this syntax to pass arguments to a shell script.

The attributes that can be set in a single-line are the attributes that are set with the `=` style, such as `inline = "echo hello"` above. If the style is instead more of a function call, such as `add_recipe "foo"`, then this cannot be specified in a single line.

Provisioners can also be named (since 1.7.0). These names are used cosmetically for output as well as overriding provisioner settings (covered further below). An example of naming provisioners is shown below:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # ... other configuration

  config.vm.provision "bootstrap", type: "shell" do |s|
    s.inline = "echo hello"
  end
end
```

Naming provisioners is simple. The first argument to `config.vm.provision` becomes the name, and then a `type` option is used to specify the provisioner type, such as `type: "shell"` above.

## Run provisioners

Provisioners are run in three cases: the initial `vagrant up`, `vagrant provision`, and `vagrant reload --provision`.

A `--no-provision` flag can be passed to `up` and `reload` if you do not want to run provisioners. Likewise, you can pass `--provision` to force provisioning.

The `--provision-with` flag can be used if you only want to run a specific provisioner if you have multiple provisioners specified. For example, if you have a shell and Puppet provisioner and only want to run the shell one, you can do `vagrant provision --provision-with shell`. The arguments to `--provision-with` can be the provisioner type (such as "shell") or the provisioner name (such as "bootstrap" from above).

## Run once, always or never

By default, provisioners are only run once, during the first `vagrant up` since the last `vagrant destroy`, unless the `--provision` flag is set, as noted above.

Optionally, you can configure provisioners to run on every `up` or `reload`. They will only be not run if the `--no-provision` flag is explicitly specified. To do this set the `run` option to "always", as shown below:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "echo hello",
    run: "always"
end
```

You can also set `run:` to `"never"` if you have an optional provisioner that you want to mention to the user in a "post up message" or that requires some other configuration before it is possible, then call this with `vagrant provision --provision-with bootstrap`.

If you are using the block format, you must specify it outside of the block, as shown below:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.provision "bootstrap", type: "shell", run: "never" do |s|
    s.inline = "echo hello"
  end
end
```

## Multiple provisioners

Multiple `config.vm.provision` methods can be used to define multiple provisioners. These provisioners will be run in the order they're defined. This is useful for a variety of reasons, but most commonly it is used so that a shell script can bootstrap some of the system so that another provisioner can take over later.

If you define provisioners at multiple "scope" levels (such as globally in the configuration block, then in a [multi-machine](/vagrant/docs/multi-machine/) definition, then maybe in a [provider-specific override](/vagrant/docs/providers/configuration)), then the outer scopes will always run _before_ any inner scopes. For example, in the Vagrantfile below:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "echo foo"

  config.vm.define "web" do |web|
    web.vm.provision "shell", inline: "echo bar"
  end

  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "echo baz"
end
```

The ordering of the provisioners will be to echo "foo", "baz", then "bar" (note the second one might not be what you expect!). Remember: ordering is _outside in_.

With multiple provisioners, use the `--provision-with` setting along with names to get more fine grained control over what is run and when.

## Override provisioner settings

<Warning heading="Advanced topic">

Provisioner overriding is an advanced topic that really only becomes useful if you are already using multi-machine and/or provider overrides. If you are just getting started with Vagrant, you can safely skip this.

</Warning>

When using features such as [multi-machine](/vagrant/docs/multi-machine/) or [provider-specific overrides](/vagrant/docs/providers/configuration), you may want to define common provisioners in the global configuration scope of a Vagrantfile, but override certain aspects of them internally. Vagrant allows you to do this, but has some details to consider.

To override settings, you must assign a name to your provisioner.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.provision "foo", type: "shell",
    inline: "echo foo"

  config.vm.define "web" do |web|
    web.vm.provision "foo", type: "shell",
      inline: "echo bar"
  end
end
```

In the above, only "bar" will be echoed, because the inline setting overloaded the outer provisioner. This overload is only effective within that scope: the "web" VM. If there were another VM defined, it would still echo "foo" unless it itself also overloaded the provisioner.

**Be careful with ordering.** When overriding a provisioner in a sub-scope, the provisioner will run at _that point_. In the example below, the output would be "foo" then "bar":

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.provision "foo", type: "shell",
    inline: "echo ORIGINAL!"

  config.vm.define "web" do |web|
    web.vm.provision "shell",
      inline: "echo foo"
    web.vm.provision "foo", type: "shell",
      inline: "echo bar"
  end
end
```

If you want to preserve the original ordering, you can specify the `preserve_order: true` flag.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.provision "do-this",
    type: "shell",
    preserve_order: true,
    inline: "echo FIRST!"
  config.vm.provision "then-this",
    type: "shell",
    preserve_order: true,
    inline: "echo SECOND!"
end
```

## Dependency provisioners

<Warning heading="Advanced topic">

Dependency provisioners are an advanced topic. If you are just getting started with Vagrant, you can safely skip this.

</Warning>

If a provisioner has been configured using the `before` or `after` options, it is considered a _Dependency Provisioner_. This means it has been configured to run before or after a _Root Provisioner_, which does not have the `before` or `after` options configured.

Dependency provisioners also have two valid shortcuts: `:each` and `:all`.

<Note>

As of 2.2.6, dependency provisioners cannot rely on other dependency provisioners and is considered a configuration state error in Vagrant. If you must order dependency provisioners, you can still order them by the order they are defined inside your Vagrantfile.

</Note>

The following example shows how to use dependency provisioners.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.provision "C", after: "B", type: "shell", inline:<<-SHELL
  echo 'C'
  SHELL
  config.vm.provision "B", type: "shell", inline:<<-SHELL
  echo 'B'
  SHELL
  config.vm.provision "D", type: "shell", inline:<<-SHELL
  echo 'D'
  SHELL
  config.vm.provision "A", before: "B", type: "shell", inline:<<-SHELL
  echo 'A'
  SHELL
  config.vm.provision "Separate After", after: :each, type: "shell", inline:<<-SHELL
  echo '=============================='
  SHELL
  config.vm.provision "Separate Before", before: :each, type: "shell", inline:<<-SHELL
  echo '++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++'
  SHELL
  config.vm.provision "Hello", before: :all, type: "shell", inline:<<-SHELL
  echo 'HERE WE GO!!'
  SHELL
  config.vm.provision "Goodbye", after: :all, type: "shell", inline:<<-SHELL
  echo 'The end'
  SHELL
end
```

The result of running `vagrant provision` with a guest configured above is:

```
==> default: Running provisioner: Hello (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: HERE WE GO!!
==> default: Running provisioner: Separate Before (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
==> default: Running provisioner: A (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: A
==> default: Running provisioner: Separate After (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: ==============================
==> default: Running provisioner: Separate Before (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
==> default: Running provisioner: B (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: B
==> default: Running provisioner: Separate After (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: ==============================
==> default: Running provisioner: Separate Before (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
==> default: Running provisioner: C (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: C
==> default: Running provisioner: Separate After (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: ==============================
==> default: Running provisioner: Separate Before (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
==> default: Running provisioner: D (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: D
==> default: Running provisioner: Separate After (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: ==============================
==> default: Running provisioner: Goodbye (shell)...
    default: Running: inline script
    default: The end
```
