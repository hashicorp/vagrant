# Providers

While Vagrant ships out of the box with support for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), [Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.io), Vagrant has the ability to manage other types of machines as well. This is done by using other _providers_ with Vagrant.

Alternate providers can offer different features that make more sense in your use case. For example, if you are using Vagrant for any real work, [VMware](https://www.vmware.com) providers are recommended since they're well supported and generally more stable and performant than VirtualBox.

Before you can use another provider, you must install it. Installation of other providers is done via the Vagrant plugin system.

Once the provider is installed, usage is straightforward and simple, as you would expect with Vagrant. Read into the relevant subsections found in the navigation to the left for more information.

## Install a provider

Providers are distributed as Vagrant plugins, and are therefore installed using [standard plugin installation steps](/vagrant/docs/plugins/usage). After installing a plugin which contains a provider, the provider should immediately be available.

## Default Provider

By default, VirtualBox is the default provider for Vagrant. VirtualBox is still the most accessible platform to use Vagrant: it is free, cross-platform, and has been supported by Vagrant for years. With VirtualBox as the default provider, it provides the lowest friction for new users to get started with Vagrant.

However, you may find after using Vagrant for some time that you prefer to use another provider as your default. In fact, this is quite common. To make this experience better, Vagrant allows specifying the default provider to use by setting the `VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` environmental variable.

Just set `VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` to the provider you wish to be the default. For example, if you use Vagrant with VMware Fusion, you can set the environmental variable to `vmware_desktop` and it will be your default.
