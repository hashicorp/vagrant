# Contacting Support

~> **Note**: You will need a Hashicorp Zendesk account to submit a support ticket. You may create an account [here](https://hashicorp.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/registration)
or when prompted by selecting the `New to Hashicorp? Sign up` link at the bottom of the sign in widget.

To submit a support ticket:
1. Go to our [Support Page](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us). You may find the answers you need by searching our support knowledge base, but if not select `Open a new ticket`.
2. To submit a new support request select `Other / No Contract` and after reading the SLA disclaimer click `I still want to submit a ticket`.
3. You will then be prompted to log in to a Hashicorp specific zendesk. If you do not have an account you can create one by clicking the `Sign up` link at the bottom of the sign in widget.

### Free Support

We do not currently publish support SLAs for free accounts, but endeavor to
respond as quickly as possible.
