# Contributing to Vagrant During Hacktoberfest

HashiCorp has some [community guidelines](https://www.hashicorp.com/community-guidelines)
to ensure our public forums are a safe space for everyone. When contributing
to Vagrant, please respect the same guidelines.

## Getting started with contributions

There are plenty of things to work on in Vagrant, not limited to writing
software. This includes:

- Fixing documentation for accuracy
- Fixing documentation for grammar and punctuation
- Finding bugs and submitting detailed issues
- Fixing or adding plugins
- Squashing bugs!

When looking through the [Vagrant issue tracker](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues)
for a good first issue, it may be useful to filter by tags. For example, the
[`needs-community-help`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/labels/needs-community-help),
[`needs-repro`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/labels/needs-repro), or
[`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/labels/good-first-issue)
tags.

Once you have found a good issue, you might want to get a development installation
working. Follow the instructions for [installing from source](/docs/installation/source)
in order to setup a development environment.

## Submitting your first pull request

Check out the [Vagrant contribution guide](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for instructions on what can be expected for the pull request lifecycle.

When submitting your changes, please ensure you have done the following:

- You have written tests for the changes made
- You have run the test suite using `bundle exec rake` and all tests pass
- You have written a descriptive commit message
- Reference the issue the pull requests resolves if applicable
