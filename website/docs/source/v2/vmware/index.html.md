# VMware

[HashiCorp](http://www.hashicorp.com) develops an official
[VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html)
and [VMware Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/)&nbsp;
[provider](/v2/providers/index.html) for Vagrant. This provider allows
Vagrant to power VMware based machines and take advantage of the
improved stability and performance that VMware software offers.

Learn more about the VMware providers on the
[VMware provider](http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware) page on
the Vagrant website.

This provider is a drop-in replacement for VirtualBox, meaning that every
VirtualBox feature that Vagrant supports is fully functional in VMware as
well. However, there are some VMware-specific things such as box formats,
configurations, etc. that are documented here.

The VMware provider is currently compatible with Fusion 5 and 6 or Workstation 9 and 10.
Fusion and Workstation must be purchased and installed separately prior to using the
provider. If the proper VMware software isn't properly installed, or an invalid version is
installed, the provider will give you a human-friendly error message.

more about.
