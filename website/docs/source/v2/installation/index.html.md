# Installing Vagrant

Installing Vagrant is extremely easy. Head over to the
[downloads page](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) and get the appropriate
installer or package for your platform. Then install it using standard
procedures for your operating system.

The installer will automatically add `vagrant` to your system path
so that it is available in terminals. If it is not found, please try
logging out and logging back in to your system (this is particularly necessary sometimes
for Windows).

If you have an old version of Vagrant 1.0.x installed via [RubyGems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems),
please remove it prior to installing a newer version of Vagrant.
