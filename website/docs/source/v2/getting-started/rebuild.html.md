# Rebuild

When you're ready to come back to your project, whether it is tomorrow,
a week from now, or a year from now, getting it up and running is easy:

```
$ vagrant up
```

That's it! Since the Vagrant environment is already all configured via
the Vagrantfile, you or any of your coworkers simply have to run a
`vagrant up` at any time and Vagrant will recreate your work environment.
