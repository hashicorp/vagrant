/**
 * Define your custom redirects within this file.
 *
 * See the README file in this directory for documentation. Please do not
 * modify or delete existing redirects without first verifying internally.
 *
 * Vercel's redirect documentation:
 * https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/redirects
 *
 * Relative paths with fragments (#) are not supported.
 * For destinations with fragments, use an absolute URL.
 *
 * Playground for testing url pattern matching: https://npm.runkit.com/path-to-regexp
 *
 * Note that redirects defined in a product's redirects file are applied to
 * the developer.hashicorp.com domain, which is where the documentation content
 * is rendered. Redirect sources should be prefixed with the product slug
 * to ensure they are scoped to the product's section. Any redirects that are
 * not prefixed with a product slug will be ignored.
