.SH NAME
vagrant \- build and distribute working environments
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vagrant
.RB [-h]
.RB [-v]
.RB [command]
.RB [--vagrantfile\ file]
.RB [machine\ ..]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing development environments.

By default, \fBvagrant\fP works with Virtual Machines (VMs) created by Virtual Box.
.SH COMMANDS
These \fBvagrant\fP commands can be run without specifying a machine, in which
case they act on the machine or machines specified in the Vagrantfile. 
.TP
.BI box\ COMMAND\ [args]\ [options]

Here are the box commands:

.RS 7
.TP
.BI add\ NAME\ URL\ [-f|--force]\ [--insecure]\ [--provider\ PROVIDER]
Adds a new box, using the NAME and the URL.

The force option overwrites an existing box if it exists already.
Validation of the SSL certificates can be overridden using the insecure option.
The name of the provider that backs the box can be specified.
.TP
.BI list
Lists all machines currently running on the system, not just from the local
directory (as vagrant status shows).
.TP
.BI remove\ NAME\ PROVIDER
Remove the named box from the specified provider.
.TP
.BI repackage\ NAME\ PROVIDER
Repackage the named box from the specified provider.
.RE
.TP
.BI destroy
Destroy the machine - use this when the machine won't be needed again.
.TP
.BI halt
Halt the machine, first by trying to shut it down nicely, then, if that fails,
by forcing it to shut down.
.TP
.BI init\ NAME\ URL
Initialize a vagrant environment in the current directory. Note that this
involves a download on the order of hundreds of megabytes and may take some
time. The local directory .vagrant will be created to store the environment.
.TP
.BI package\ --base\ NAME\ --output\ FILE\ [options]
Package the named machine into the output file.  

Optionally include files x, y and z ([--include x,y,z]), and a named vagrant
file ([--vagrantfile file]).
.TP
.BI plugin\ install\ GEM
Install the specified Ruby gem as a plugin to vagrant.
.TP
.BI provision\ [--provision-with\ x,y,z]
Run all the provisioning scripts on the machine, or just specified scripts.
.TP
.BI reload\ [--[no-]provision]\ [--provision-with\ x,y,z]
Reload the machine's configuration. This does a shutdown/restart cycle of the
machine, known in this context as halt/up.

Provisioning can explicitly be enabled or disabled, and specific provisioners
x, y and z can be specified.
.TP
.BI resume 
Resume the operation of the previously suspended machine.
.TP
.BI ssh\ [-c|--command\ COMMAND]\ [-p|--plain]
Ssh into the machine. This starts a session as the vagrant user; this user has
sudo privilege.

The command option executes an ssh command directly; the plain option leaves
the authentication up to the user.
.TP
.BI ssh-config\ [--host\ COMMAND]
Displays the ssh configuration for the machine.  These values can be adjusted
in the Vagrantfile configuration file.

The host option renames the Host parameter in the output.

Note that the ssh connection uses an insecure private key which should be fine
for development, but should not be considered secure for a production
environment.
.TP
.BI status
Show the status of all of the machines.
.TP
.BI suspend
Suspend the operation of the machine.  The suspended machine can be brought
back to life with either the resume command or the up command.
.TP
.BI up
Boot up the specified machine, whether it's halted or just suspended.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI -h
Display basic help for vagrant.
.TP
.BI -v
Display version information for vagrant.
.TP
.BI --vagrantfile\ [file]
Specify a vagrant configuration file different from the default (Vagrantfile).
