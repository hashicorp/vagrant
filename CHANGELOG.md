## 1.8.3 (June 10, 2016)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  - The `winrm` communicator now shares the same upload behavior as the `ssh`
      communicator. This change should have no impact to most vagrant operations
      but may break behavior when uploading directories to an existing
      destination target. The `file` provisioner should be the only builtin
      provisioner affected by this change. When uploading a directory and the
      destination directory exists on the endpoint, the source base directory
      will be created below the destination directory on the endpoint and the
      source directory contents will be unzipped to that location. Prior to this
      release, the contents of the source directory would be unzipped to an
      existing destination directory without creating the source base directory.
      This new behavior is more consistent with SCP and other well known shell copy commands.
  - The Chef provisioner's `channel` default value has changed from "current" to
      "stable". The "current" channel includes nightly releases and should be
      opt-in only. Note that users wishing to download the Chef Development Kit
      will need to opt into the "current" channel until Chef Software promotes
      into the "stable" channel.
  - The Arch Linux host capability for NFS removed support for rc.d in favor or
      systemd which has been present since 2012. Please see GH-7181 for more
      information.

FEATURES:

  - provider/docker: Allow non-linux users to opt-out of the host VM to run
      Docker containers by setting `config.force_host_vm = false` in the
      Vagrantfile. This is especially useful for customers who wish to use
      the beta builds for Mac and Windows, dlite, or a custom provider.
      [GH-7277, GH-7298, 8c11b53]
  - provider/docker: New command: `docker-exec` allows attaching to an
      already-running container.

## 1.8.0 (December 21, 2015)

FEATURES:

  - **New Command: `vagrant powershell`**: For machines that support it,
    this will open a PowerShell prompt.
  - **New Command: `vagrant port`**: For machines that support it, this will
    display the list of forwarded ports from the guest to the host.
  - **Linked Clones**: VirtualBox and VMware providers now support
    linked clones for very fast (millisecond) imports on up. [GH-4484]
  - **Snapshots**: The `vagrant snapshot` command can be used to checkpoint
    and restore point-in-time snapshots.
  - **IPv6 Private Networks**: Private networking now supports IPv6. This
    only works with VirtualBox and VMware at this point. [GH-6342]
  - New provisioner: `ansible_local` to execute Ansible from the guest
    machine. [GH-2103]

BREAKING CHANGES:

  - The `ansible` provisioner now can override the effective ansible remote user
    (i.e. `ansible_ssh_user` setting) to always correspond to the vagrant ssh
    username. This change is enabled by default, but we expect this to affect
    only a tiny number of people as it corresponds to the common usage.
    If you however use multiple remote usernames in your Ansible plays, tasks,
    or custom inventories, you can simply set the option `force_remote_user` to
    false to make Vagrant behave the same as before.
  - provisioners/salt: the "config_dir" option has been removed. It has no
      effect in Vagrant 1.8. [GH-6073]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - core: allow removal of all box versions with `--all` flag [GH-3462]
  - core: prune entries from global status on non-existent cwd [GH-6535]

  - core: run provisioner cleanup tasks before powering off the VM [GH-6553]

      sources, primarily for corp firewalls. [GH-4738]

## 1.7.2 (January 6, 2015)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  - If you depended on the paths that Chef/Puppet provisioners use to
    store cookbooks (ex. "/tmp/vagrant-chef-1"), these will no longer be
    correct. Without this change, Chef/Puppet didn't work at all with
    `vagrant provision`. We expect this to affect only a minor number of
    people, since it's not something that was ever documented or recommended
    by Vagrant, or even meant to be supported.

FEATURES:

  - provisioners/salt: add support for grains [GH-4895]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - commands/reload,up: `--provision-with` implies `--provision` [GH-5085]

  - core: private boxes still referencing vagrantcloud.com will have
      their vagrant login access token properly appended
  - core: push plugin configuration is properly validated
  - core: restore box packaging functionality
  - commands/package: fix crash
  - commands/push: push lookups are by user-defined name, not push
      strategy name [GH-4975]

  - communicators/winrm: detect parse errors in PowerShell and error
  - guests/arch: fix network configuration due to poor line breaks. [GH-4964]

      in default Vagrantfiles. [GH-5092]
  - installer: SSL cert bundle contains 1024-bit keys, fixing SSL verification
      for a lot of sites.
  - installer: vagrant executable properly `cygpaths` the SSL bundle path
      for Cygwin
  - installer: Nokogiri (XML lib used by Vagrant and dependencies) linker
      dependencies fixed, fixing load issues on some platforms
  - providers/docker: Symlinks in shared folders work. [GH-5093]
  - providers/hyperv: VM start errors turn into proper Vagrant errors. [GH-5101]

      added with plugins.
  - **Named provisioners**: Provisioners can now be named. This name is used
      for output as well as `--provision-with` for better control.
  - Default provider logic improved: Providers in `config.vm.provider` blocks
      in your Vagrantfile now have higher priority than plugins. Earlier
      providers are chosen before later ones. [GH-3812]
  - If the default insecure keypair is used, Vagrant will automatically replace
      it with a randomly generated keypair on first `vagrant up`. [GH-2608]

## 1.6.0 (May 6, 2014)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  - Deprecated: `halt_timeout` and `halt_check_interval` settings for
      SmartOS, Solaris, and Solaris11 guests. These will be fully
      removed in 1.7. A warning will be shown if they're in use in
      1.6.

FEATURES:

  - **New guest: Windows**. Vagrant now fully supports Windows as a guest
      VM. WinRM can be used for communication (or SSH), and the shell
      provisioner, Chef, and Puppet all work with Windows VMs.
  - **New command: global-status**. This command shows the state of every
      created Vagrant environment on the system for that logged in user.
  - **New command: rdp**. This command connects to the running machine
      via the Remote Desktop Protocol.
  - **New command: version**. This outputs the currently installed version
      as well as the latest version of Vagrant available.
  - **New provider: Docker**. This provider will back your development
      environments with Docker containers. If you're not on Linux, it will
      automatically spin up a VM for you on any provider. You can even
      specify a specific Vagrantfile to use as the Docker container host.
  - Control Vagrant environments from any directory. Using the UUIDs given
      in `vagrant global-status`, you can issue commands from anywhere on
      your machine, not just that environment's directory. Example:
      `vagrant destroy UUID` from anywhere.
  - Can now specify a `post_up_message` in your Vagrantfile that is shown
      after a `vagrant up`. This is useful for putting some instructions of how
      to use the development environment.
  - Can configure provisioners to run "once" or "always" (defaults to "once"),
      so that subsequent `vagrant up` or `reload` calls will always run a
      provisioner. [GH-2421]
  - Multi-machine environments can specify an "autostart" option (default
      to true). `vagrant up` starts all machines that have enabled autostart.
  - Vagrant is smarter about choosing a default provider. If
    `VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` is set, it still takes priority, but otherwise
    Vagrant chooses a "best" provider.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - core: Vagrant locks machine access to one Vagrant process at a time.
      This will protect against two simultaneous `up` actions happening
      on the same environment.
  - core: Boxes can be compressed with LZMA now as well.
  - commands/box/remove: Warns if the box appears to be in use by an
      environment. Can be forced with `--force`.
  - commands/destroy: Exit codes changes. 0 means everything succeeded.
      1 means everything was declined. 2 means some were declined. [GH-811]
  - commands/destroy: Doesn't require box to exist anymore. [GH-1629]
  - commands/init: force flag. [GH-3564]
  - commands/init: flag for minimal Vagrantfile creation (no comments). [GH-3611]
  - commands/rsync-auto: Picks up and syncs provisioner folders if
      provisioners are backed by rsync.
  - commands/rsync-auto: Detects when new synced folders were added and warns
      user they won't be synced until `vagrant reload`.
  - commands/ssh-config: Works without a target in multi-machine envs [GH-2844]
  - guests/freebsd: Support for virtio interfaces. [GH-3082]
  - guests/openbsd: Support for virtio interfaces. [GH-3082]
  - guests/redhat: Networking works for upcoming RHEL7 release. [GH-3643]
  - providers/hyperv: Implement `vagrant ssh -c` support. [GH-3615]
  - provisioners/ansible: Support for Ansible Vault. [GH-3338]
  - provisioners/ansible: Show Ansible command executed. [GH-3628]
  - provisioners/salt: Colorize option. [GH-3603]
  - provisioners/salt: Ability to specify log level. [GH-3603]
  - synced\_folders: nfs: Improve sudo commands used to make them
      sudoers friendly. Examples in docs. [GH-3638]

BUG FIXES:

  - core: Adding a box from a network share on Windows works again. [GH-3279]
  - commands/plugin/install: Specific versions are now locked in.
  - commands/plugin/install: If insecure RubyGems.org is specified as a
      source, use that. [GH-3610]
  - commands/rsync-auto: Interrupt exits properly. [GH-3552]
  - commands/rsync-auto: Run properly on Windows. [GH-3547]
  - communicators/ssh: Detect if `config.ssh.shell` is invalid. [GH-3040]
  - guests/debian: Can set hostname if hosts doesn't contain an entry
      already for 127.0.1.1 [GH-3271]
  - guests/linux: For `read_ip_address` capability, set `LANG=en` so
      it works on international systems. [GH-3029]
  - providers/virtualbox: VirtalBox detection works properly again on
      Windows when the `VBOX_INSTALL_PATH` has multiple elements. [GH-3549]
  - providers/virtualbox: Forcing MAC address on private network works
      properly again. [GH-3588]
  - provisioners/chef-solo: Fix Chef version checking to work with prerelease
      versions. [GH-3604]
  - provisioners/salt: Always copy keys and configs on provision. [GH-3536]
  - provisioners/salt: Install args should always be present with bootstrap.
  - provisioners/salt: Overwrite keys properly on subsequent provisions [GH-3575]
  - provisioners/salt: Bootstrap uses raw GitHub URL rather than subdomain. [GH-3583]
  - synced\_folders/nfs: Acquires a process-level lock so exports don't
      collide with Vagrant running in parallel.
  - synced\_folders/nfs: Implement usability check so that hosts that
      don't support NFS get an error earlier. [GH-3625]
  - synced\_folders/rsync: Add UserKnownHostsFile option to not complain. [GH-3511]
  - synced\_folders/rsync: Proxy command is used properly if set. [GH-3553]
  - synced\_folders/rsync: Owner/group settings are respected. [GH-3544]
  - synced\_folders/smb: Passwords with symbols work. [GH-3642]

PLUGIN AUTHOR CHANGES:

  - **New host capability:** "rdp\_client". This capability gets the RDP connection
      info and must launch the RDP client on the system.
  - core: The "Call" middleware now merges the resulting middleware stack
      into the current stack, rather than running it as a separate stack.
      The result is that ordering is preserved.
  - core: The "Message" middleware now takes a "post" option that will
      output the message on the return-side of the middleware stack.
  - core: Forwarded port collision repair works when Vagrant is run in
      parallel with other Vagrant processes. [GH-2966]
  - provider: Providers can now specify that boxes are optional. This lets
      you use the provider without a `config.vm.box`. Useful for providers like
      AWS or Docker.
  - provider: A new class-level `usable?` method can be implemented on the
      provider implementation. This returns or raises an error when the
      provider is not usable (i.e. VirtualBox isn't installed for VirtualBox)
  - synced\_folders: New "disable" method for removing synced folders from
      a running machine.

## 1.5.0 (March 10, 2014)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  - provisioners/ansible: the machine name (taken from Vagrantfile) is now
    set as default limit to ensure that vagrant provision steps only
    affect the expected machine.

DEPRECATIONS:

  - provisioners/chef-solo: The "nfs" setting has been replaced by
    `synced_folder_type`. The "nfs" setting will be removed in the next
    version.
  - provisioners/puppet: The "nfs" setting has been replaced by
    `synced_folder_type`. The "nfs" setting will be removed in the next
    version.

FEATURES:

  - **New provider:** Hyper-V. If you're on a Windows machine with Hyper-V
    enabled, Vagrant can now manage Hyper-V virtual machines out of the box.
  - **New guest:** Funtoo (change host name and networks supported)
  - **New guest:** NetBSD
  - **New guest:** TinyCore Linux. This allows features such as networking,
    halting, rsync and more work with Boot2Docker.
  - **New synced folder type:** rsync - Does a one-time one-directional sync
    to the guest machine. New commands `vagrant rsync` and `vagrant rsync-auto`
    can resync the folders.
  - **New synced folder type:** SMB- Allows bi-directional folder syncing
    using SMB on Windows hosts with any guest.
  - Password-based SSH authentication. This lets you use almost any off-the-shelf
    virtual machine image with Vagrant. Additionally, Vagrant will automatically
    insert a keypair into the machine.
  - Plugin versions can now be constrained to a range of versions. Example:
    `vagrant plugin install foo --plugin-version "> 1.0, < 1.1"`
  - Host-specific operations now use a "host capabilities" system much like
    guests have used "guest capabilities" for a few releases now. This allows
    plugin developers to create pluggable host-specific capabilities and makes
    further integrating Vagrant with new operating systems even easier.
  - You can now override provisioners within sub-VM configuration and
    provider overrides. See documentation for more info. [GH-1113]
  - providers/virtualbox: Provider-specific configuration `cpus` can be used
    to set the number of CPUs on the VM [GH-2800]
  - provisioners/docker: Can now build images using `docker build`. [GH-2615]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - core: Added "error-exit" type to machine-readable output which contains
    error information that caused a non-zero exit status. [GH-2999]
  - command/destroy: confirmation will re-ask question if bad input. [GH-3027]
  - guests/solaris: More accurate Solaris >= 11, < 11 detection. [GH-2824]
  - provisioners/ansible: Generates a single inventory file, rather than
    one per machine. See docs for more info. [GH-2991]
  - provisioners/ansible: SSH forwarding support. [GH-2952]
  - provisioners/ansible: Multiple SSH keys can now be attempted [GH-2952]
  - provisioners/ansible: Disable SSH host key checking by default,
    which improves the experience. We believe this is a sane default
    for ephemeral dev machines.
  - provisioners/chef-solo: New config `synced_folder_type` replaces the
    `nfs` option. This can be used to set the synced folders the provisioner
    needs to any type. [GH-2709]
  - provisioners/chef-solo: `roles_paths` can now be an array of paths in
    Chef 11.8.0 and newer. [GH-2975]
  - provisioners/docker: Can start a container without daemonization.
  - provisioners/docker: Started containers are given names. [GH-3051]
  - provisioners/puppet: New config `synced_folder_type` replaces the
    `nfs` option. This can be used to set the synced folders the provisioner
    needs to any type. [GH-2709]
  - commands/plugin: `vagrant plugin update` will now update all installed
    plugins, respecting any constraints set.
  - commands/plugin: `vagrant plugin uninstall` can now uninstall multiple
    plugins.
  - commands/plugin: `vagrant plugin install` can now install multiple
    plugins.
  - hosts/redhat: Recognize Korora OS. [GH-2869]
  - synced\_folders/nfs: If the guest supports it, NFS clients will be
    automatically installed in the guest.

BUG FIXES:

  - core: If an exception was raised while attempting to connect to SSH
    for the first time, it would get swallowed. It is properly raised now.
  - core: Plugin installation does not fail if your local gemrc file has
    syntax errors.
  - core: Plugins that fork within certain actions will no longer hang
    indefinitely. [GH-2756]
  - core: Windows checks home directory permissions more correctly to
    warn of potential issues.
  - core: Synced folders set to the default synced folder explicitly won't
    be deleted. [GH-2873]

  - core: Adding boxes that have directories in them works on Windows.
  - core: Vagrant will not think provisioning is already done if
    the VM is manually deleted outside of Vagrant.
  - core: Box file checksums of large files works properly on Windows.
    [GH-3045]

  - hosts/bsd: No more checkexports NFS errors if you're sharing the
    same directory. [GH-3023]
  - hosts/gentoo: Look for systemctl in `/usr/bin` [GH-2858]
  - hosts/linux: Properly escape regular expression to prune NFS exports,
    allowing VMware to work properly. [GH-2934]
  - hosts/opensuse: Start NFS server properly. [GH-2923]
  - providers/virtualbox: Enabling internal networks by just setting "true"

    machine before and after provisioning also with Chef client. [GH-2845]
  - provisioners/chef: Set `encrypted_data_bag_secret` on the VM to `nil`
    if the secret is not specified. [GH-2984]
  - provisioners/chef: Fix loading of the custom configure file. [GH-876]
  - provisioners/docker: Only add SSH user to docker group if the user
    isn't already in it. [GH-2838]

    the newest versions of Docker. [GH-2874]
  - provisioners/puppet: Append default module path to the module paths
    always. [GH-2677]
  - provisioners/salt: Setting pillar data doesn't require `deep_merge`
    plugin anymore. [GH-2348]

    VirtualBox shared folders [GH-2197]
  - hosts/arch: NFS exporting works properly, no exceptions. [GH-2161]

    for folders with sudo. [GH-2121]

## 1.3.0 (September 5, 2013)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY:

    uses a simple overall timeout value `config.vm.boot_timeout` to wait for
    the machine to boot up.
  - `config.vm.graceful_halt_retry_*` settings are gone. Instead, a single
    timeout is now used to wait for a graceful halt to work, specified
    by `config.vm.graceful_halt_timeout`.
  - The ':extra' flag to shared folders for specifying arbitrary mount
    options has been replaced with the `:mount_options` flag, which is now
    an array of mount options.
  - `vagrant up` will now only run provisioning by default the first time
   it is run. Subsequent `reload` or `up` will need to explicitly specify
   the `--provision` flag to provision. [GH-1776]

FEATURES:

  - New command: `vagrant plugin update` to update specific installed plugins.

  - Provisioners can now define "cleanup" tasks that are executed on
    `vagrant destroy`. [GH-1302]
  - Chef Client provisioner will now clean up the node/client using
    `knife` if configured to do so.
  - `vagrant up` has a `--no-destroy-on-error` flag that will not destroy
    the VM if a fatal error occurs. [GH-2011]
  - NFS: Arbitrary mount options can be specified using the
   `mount_options` option on synced folders. [GH-1029]
  - NFS: Arbitrary export options can be specified using
   `bsd__nfs_options` and `linux__nfs_options`. [GH-1029]
  - Static IP can now be set on public networks. [GH-1745]
  - Add `Vagrant.has_plugin?` method for use in Vagrantfile to check
    if a plugin is installed. [GH-1736]
  - Support for remote shell provisioning scripts [GH-1787]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - core: add `--color` to any Vagrant command to FORCE color output. [GH-2027]
  - core: "config.vm.host_name" works again, just an alias to hostname.
  - core: Reboots via SSH are now handled gracefully (without exception).
  - core: Mark `disabled` as true on forwarded port to disable. [GH-1922]
  - core: NFS exports are now namespaced by user ID, so pruning NFS won't
    remove exports from other users. [GH-1511]

  - commands/box/remove: Fix stack trace that happens if no provider
    is specified. [GH-2100]

BUG FIXES:

  - On Windows, properly convert synced folder host path to a string
    so that separator replacement works properly.
  - Use `--color=false` for no color in Puppet to support older
    versions properly. [GH-2000]
  - Make sure the hostname configuration is a string. [GH-1999]
  - cURL downloads now contain a user agent which fixes some
    issues with downloading Vagrant through proxies. [GH-2003]
  - `vagrant plugin install` will now always properly show the actual
    installed gem name. [GH-1834]

## 1.2.6 (July 26, 2013)

BUG FIXES:

  - Box collections with multiple formats work properly by converting
    the supported formats to symbols. [GH-1990]

## 1.2.5 (July 26, 2013)

FEATURES:

  - `vagrant help <command>` now works. [GH-1578]
  - Added `config.vm.box_download_insecure` to allow the box_url setting
    to point to an https site that won't be validated. [GH-1712]
  - VirtualBox VBoxManage customizations can now be specified to run
    pre-boot (the default and existing functionality, pre-import,
    or post-boot. [GH-1247]
  - VirtualBox no longer destroys unused network interfaces by default.
    This didn't work across multi-user systems and required admin privileges
    on Windows, so it has been disabled by default. It can be enabled using
    the VirtualBox provider-specific `destroy_unused_network_interfaces`
    configuration by setting it to true. [GH-1324]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Remote commands that fail will now show the stdout/stderr of the
    command that failed. [GH-1203]

    functionality removed in 1.1 from "config.dotfile_name" [GH-1524]
  - Vagrant will show an error if VirtualBox 4.2.14 is running.
  - Added provider to BoxNotFound error message. [GH-1692]
  - If Ansible fails to run properly, show an error message. [GH-1699]
  - Adding a box with the `--provider` flag will now allow a box for
    any of that provider's supported formats.
  - NFS mounts enable UDP by default, resulting in higher performance.
    (Because mount is over local network, packet loss is not an issue)
   [GH-1706]

BUG FIXES:

  - `box_url` now handles the case where the provider doesn't perfectly
    match the provider in use, but the provider supports it. [GH-1752]
  - Fix uninitialized constant error when configuring Arch Linux network. [GH-1734]
  - Debian/Ubuntu change hostname works properly if eth0 is configured
    with hot-plugging. [GH-1929]
  - NFS exports with improper casing on Mac OS X work properly. [GH-1202]
  - Shared folders overriding '/vagrant' in multi-VM environments no
    longer all just use the last value. [GH-1935]
  - NFS export fsid's are now 32-bit integers, rather than UUIDs. This
    lets NFS exports work with Linux kernels older than 2.6.20. [GH-1127]
  - NFS export allows access from all private networks on the VM. [GH-1204]
  - Default VirtualBox VM name now contains the machine name as defined
    in the Vagrantfile, helping differentiate multi-VM. [GH-1281]
  - NFS works properly on CentOS hosts. [GH-1394]
  - Solaris guests actually shut down properly. [GH-1506]
  - All provisioners only output newlines when the provisioner sends a
    newline. This results in the output looking a lot nicer.
  - Sharing folders works properly if ".profile" contains an echo. [GH-1677]
  - `vagrant ssh-config` IdentityFile is only wrapped in quotes if it
    contains a space. [GH-1682]
  - Shared folder target path can be a Windows path. [GH-1688]
  - Forwarded ports don't auto-correct by default, and will raise an
    error properly if they collide. [GH-1701]
  - Retry SSH on ENETUNREACH error. [GH-1732]
  - NFS is silently ignored on Windows. [GH-1748]
  - Validation so that private network static IP does not end in ".1" [GH-1750]
  - With forward agent enabled and sudo being used, Vagrant will automatically
    discover and set `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` remotely so that forward agent
    works properly despite misconfigured sudoers. [GH-1307]
  - Synced folder paths on Windows containing '\' are replaced with
    '/' internally so that they work properly.
  - Unused config objects are finalized properly. [GH-1877]
  - Private networks work with Fedora guests once again. [GH-1738]
  - Default internal encoding of strings in Vagrant is now UTF-8, allowing
    detection of Fedora to work again (which contained a UTF-8 string). [GH-1977]

## 1.2.4 (July 16, 2013)

FEATURES:

  - Chef solo and client provisioning now support a `custom_config_path`
    setting that accepts a path to a Ruby file to load as part of Chef
    configuration, allowing you to override any setting available. [GH-876]
  - CFEngine provisioner: you can now specify the package name to install,
    so CFEngine enterprise is supported. [GH-1920]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - `vagrant box remove` works with only the name of the box if that
    box exists only backed by one provider. [GH-1032]
  - `vagrant destroy` returns exit status 1 if any of the confirmations
    are declined. [GH-923]
  - Forwarded ports can specify a host IP and guest IP to bind to. [GH-1121]
  - You can now set the "ip" of a private network that uses DHCP. This will
    change the subnet and such that the DHCP server uses.
  - Add `file_cache_path` support for chef_solo. [GH-1897]

BUG FIXES:

  - VBoxManage or any other executable missing from PATH properly
    reported. Regression from 1.2.2. [GH-1928]
  - Boxes downloaded as part of `vagrant up` are now done so _prior_ to
    config validation. This allows Vagrantfiles to references files that
    may be in the box itself. [GH-1061]
  - Chef removes dna.json and encrypted data bag secret file prior to
    uploading. [GH-1111]
  - NFS synced folders exporting sub-directories of other exported folders now
    works properly. [GH-785]
  - NFS shared folders properly dereference symlinks so that the real path
    is used, avoiding mount errors [GH-1101]
  - SSH channel is closed after the exit status is received, potentially
    eliminating any SSH hangs. [GH-603]
  - Fix regression where VirtualBox detection wasn't working anymore. [GH-1918]
  - NFS shared folders with single quotes in their name now work properly. [GH-1166]
  - Debian/Ubuntu request DHCP renewal when hostname changes, which will
    fix issues with FQDN detecting. [GH-1929]
  - SSH adds the "DSAAuthentication=yes" option in case that is disabled
    on the user's system. [GH-1900]

## 1.2.3 (July 9, 2013)

FEATURES:

  - Puppet provisioner now supports Hiera by specifying a `hiera_config_path`.
  - Added a `working_directory` configuration option to the Puppet apply
    provisioner so you can specify the working directory when `puppet` is
    called, making it friendly to Hiera data and such. [GH-1670]
  - Ability to specify the host IP to bind forwarded ports to. [GH-1785]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Setting hostnames works properly on OmniOS. [GH-1672]
  - Better VBoxManage error detection on Windows systems. This avoids
    some major issues where Vagrant would sometimes "lose" your VM. [GH-1669]
  - Better detection of missing VirtualBox kernel drivers on Linux
    systems. [GH-1671]
  - More precise detection of Ubuntu/Debian guests so that running Vagrant
    within an LXC container works properly now.
  - Allow strings in addition to symbols to more places in V1 configuration
    as well as V2 configuration.
  - Add `ARPCHECK=0` to RedHat OS family network configuration. [GH-1815]
  - Add SSH agent forwarding sample to initial Vagrantfile. [GH-1808]
  - VirtualBox: Only configure networks if there are any to configure.
    This allows linux's that don't implement this capability to work with
    Vagrant. [GH-1796]
  - Default SSH forwarded port now binds to 127.0.0.1 so only local
    connections are allowed. [GH-1785]
  - Use `netctl` for Arch Linux network configuration. [GH-1760]
  - Improve fedora host detection regular expression. [GH-1913]
  - SSH shows a proper error on EHOSTUNREACH. [GH-1911]

BUG FIXES:

  - Ignore "guest not ready" errors when attempting to graceful halt and
    carry on checks whether the halt succeeded. [GH-1679]
  - Handle the case where a roles path for Chef solo isn't properly
	defined. [GH-1665]
  - Finding V1 boxes now works properly again to avoid "box not found"
    errors. [GH-1691]
  - Setting hostname on SLES 11 works again. [GH-1781]
  - `config.vm.guest` properly forces guests again. [GH-1800]
  - The `read_ip_address` capability for linux properly reads the IP
    of only the first network interface. [GH-1799]
  - Validate that an IP is given for a private network. [GH-1788]
  - Fix uninitialized constant error for Gentoo plugin. [GH-1698]

## 1.2.2 (April 23, 2013)

FEATURES:

  - New `DestroyConfirm` built-in middleware for providers so they can
    more easily conform to the `destroy` action.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - No longer an error if the Chef run list is empty. It is now
    a warning. [GH-1620]
  - Better locking around handling the `box_url` parameter for
    parallel providers.
  - Solaris guest is now properly detected on SmartOS, OmniOS, etc. [GH-1639]
  - Guest addition version detection is more robust, attempting other
    routes to get the version, and also retrying a few times. [GH-1575]

BUG FIXES:

  - `vagrant package --base` works again. [GH-1615]
  - Box overrides specified in provider config overrides no longer
    fail to detect the box. [GH-1617]
  - In a multi-machine environment, a box not found won't be downloaded
    multiple times. [GH-1467]
  - `vagrant box add` with a file path now works correctly on Windows
    when a drive letter is specified.
  - DOS line endings are converted to Unix line endings for the
    shell provisioner automatically. [GH-1495]

## 1.2.1 (April 17, 2013)

FEATURES:

  - Add a `--[no-]parallel` flag to `vagrant up` to enable/disable
    parallelism. Vagrant will parallelize by default.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Get rid of arbitrary 4 second sleep when connecting via SSH. The
    issue it was attempting to work around may be gone now.

BUG FIXES:

  - Chef solo run list properly set. [GH-1608]
  - Follow 30x redirects when downloading boxes. [GH-1607]
  - Chef client config defaults are done properly. [GH-1609]
  - VirtualBox mounts shared folders with the proper owner/group. [GH-1611]
  - Use the Mozilla CA cert bundle for cURL so SSL validation works
    properly.

## 1.2.0 (April 16, 2013)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  - WINDOWS USERS: Vagrant now defaults to using the 'USERPROFILE' environmental
    variable for the home directory if it is set. This means that the default
    location for the Vagrant home directory is now `%USERPROFILE%/.vagrant.d`.
    On Cygwin, this will cause existing Cygwin users to "lose" their boxes.
    To work around this, either set `VAGRANT_HOME` to your Cygwin ".vagrant.d"
    folder or move your ".vagrant.d" folder to `USERPROFILE`. The latter is
    recommended for long-term support.
  - The constant `Vagrant::Environment::VAGRANT_HOME` was removed in favor of
    `Vagrant::Environment#default_vagrant_home`.

FEATURES:

  - Providers can now parallelize! If they explicitly support it, Vagrant
    will run "up" and other commands in parallel. For providers such AWS,
    this means that your instances will come up in parallel. VirtualBox
    does not support this mode.
  - Box downloads are now done via `curl` rather than Ruby's built-in
    HTTP library. This results in massive speedups, support for SSL
    verification, FTP downloads, and more.
  - `config.vm.provider` now takes an optional second parameter to the block,
    allowing you to override any configuration value. These overrides are
    applied last, and therefore override any other configuration value.
    Note that while this feature is available, the "Vagrant way" is instead
    to use box manifests to ensure that the "box" for every provider matches,
    so these sorts of overrides are unnecessary.
  - A new "guest capabilities" system to replace the old "guest" system.
    This new abstraction allows plugins to define "capabilities" that
    certain guest operating systems can implement. This allows greater
    flexibility in doing guest-specific behavior.
  - Ansible provisioner support. [GH-1465]
  - Providers can now support multiple box formats by specifying the
    `box_format:` option.
  - CFEngine provisioner support.
  - `config.ssh.default` settings introduced to set SSH defaults that
    providers can still override. [GH-1479]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Full Windows support in cmd.exe, PowerShell, Cygwin, and MingW based
    environments.
  - By adding the "disabled" boolean flag to synced folders you can disable
    them altogether. [GH-1004]
  - Specify the default provider with the `VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`
    environmental variable. [GH-1478]
  - Invalid settings are now caught and shown in a user-friendly way. [GH-1484]
  - Detect PuTTY Link SSH client on Windows and show an error. [GH-1518]
  - `vagrant ssh` in Cygwin won't output DOS path file warnings.
  - Add `--rtcuseutc on` as a sane default for VirtualBox. [GH-912]
  - SSH will send keep-alive packets every 5 seconds by default to
    keep connections alive. Can be disabled with `config.ssh.keep_alive`. [GH-516]
  - Show a message on `vagrant up` if the machine is already running. [GH-1558]
  - "Running provisioner" output now shoes the provisioner shortcut name,
    rather than the less-than-helpful class name.
  - Shared folders with the same guest path will overwrite each other. No
    more shared folder IDs.
  - Shell provisioner outputs script it is running. [GH-1568]
  - Automatically merge forwarded ports that share the same host
    port.

BUG FIXES:

  - The `:mac` option for host-only networks is respected. [GH-1536]
  - Don't preserve modified time when untarring boxes. [GH-1539]
  - Forwarded port auto-correct will not auto-correct to a port
    that is also in use.
  - Cygwin will always output color by default. Specify `--no-color` to
    override this.
  - Assume Cygwin has a TTY for asking for input. [GH-1430]
  - Expand Cygwin paths to Windows paths for calls to VBoxManage and
    for VirtualBox shared folders.
  - Output the proper clear line text for shells in Cygwin when
    reporting dynamic progress.
  - When using `Builder` instances for hooks, the builders will be
    merged for the proper before/after chain. [GH-1555]
  - Use the Vagrant temporary directory again for temporary files
    since they can be quite large and were messing with tmpfs. [GH-1442]
  - Fix issue parsing extra SSH args in `vagrant ssh` in multi-machine
    environments. [GH-1545]
  - Networks come back up properly on RedHat systems after reboot. [GH-921]
  - `config.ssh` settings override all detected SSH settings (regression). [GH-1479]
  - `ssh-config` won't raise an exception if the VirtualBox machine
    is not created. [GH-1562]
  - Multiple machines defined in the same Vagrantfile with the same
    name will properly merge.
  - More robust hostname checking for RedHat. [GH-1566]
  - Cookbook path existence for Chef is no longer an error, so that
    things like librarian and berkshelf plugins work properly. [GH-1570]
  - Chef solo provisioner uses proper SSH username instead of hardcoded
    config. [GH-1576]
  - Shell provisioner takes ownership of uploaded files properly so
    that they can also be manually executed later. [GH-1576]

## 1.1.6 (April 3, 2013)

BUG FIXES:

  - Fix SSH re-use connection logic to drop connection if an
    error occurs.

## 1.1.5 (April 2, 2013)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - More robust SSH connection close detection.
  - Don't load `vagrant plugin` installed plugins when in a Bundler
    environment. This happens during plugin development. This will make
    Vagrant errors much quieter when developing plugins.
  - Vagrant will detect Bundler environments, make assumptions that you're
    developing plugins, and will quiet its error output a bit.
  - More comprehensive synced folder configuration validation.
  - VBoxManage errors now show the output from the command so that
    users can potentially know what is wrong.

BUG FIXES:

  - Proper error message if invalid provisioner is used. [GH-1515]
  - Don't error on graceful halt if machine just shut down very
    quickly. [GH-1505]
  - Error message if private key for SSH isn't owned by the proper
    user. [GH-1503]
  - Don't error too early when `config.vm.box` is not properly set.
  - Show a human-friendly error if VBoxManage is not found (exit
    status 126). [GH-934]
  - Action hook prepend/append will only prepend or append once.
  - Retry SSH on Errno::EACCES.
  - Show an error if an invalid network type is used.
  - Don't share Chef solo folder if it doesn't exist on host.

## 1.1.4 (March 25, 2013)

BUG FIXES:

  - Default forwarded port adapter for VirtualBox should be 1.

## 1.1.3 (March 25, 2013)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Puppet apply provisioner now retains the default module path
    even while specifying custom module paths. [GH-1207]
  - Re-added DHCP support for host-only networks. [GH-1466]
  - Ability to specify a plugin version, plugin sources, and
    pre-release versions using `--plugin-version`, `--plugin-source`,
    and `--plugin-prerelease`. [GH-1461]
  - Move VirtualBox guest addition checks to after the machine
    boots. [GH-1179]
  - Removed `Vagrant::TestHelpers` because it doesn't really work anymore.
  - Add PLX linux guest support. [GH-1490]

BUG FIXES:

  - Attempt to re-establish SSH connection on `Net::SSH::Disconnect`
  - Allow any value that can convert to a string for `Vagrant.plugin`
  - Chef solo `recipe_url` works properly again. [GH-1467]
  - Port collision detection works properly in VirtualBox with
    auto-corrected ports. [GH-1472]
  - Fix obscure error when temp directory is world writable when
    adding boxes.
  - Improved error handling around network interface detection for
    VirtualBox [GH-1480]

## 1.1.2 (March 18, 2013)

BUG FIXES:

  - When not specifying a cookbooks_path for chef-solo, an error won't
    be shown if "cookbooks" folder is missing.
  - Fix typo for exception when no host-only network with NFS. [GH-1448]
  - Use UNSET_VALUE/nil with args on shell provisioner by default since
    `[]` was too truthy. [GH-1447]

## 1.1.1 (March 18, 2013)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Don't load plugins on any `vagrant plugin` command, so that errors
    are avoided. [GH-1418]
  - An error will be shown if you forward a port to the same host port
    multiple times.
  - Automatically convert network, provider, and provisioner names to
    symbols internally in case people define them as strings.
  - Using newer versions of net-ssh and net-scp. [GH-1436]

BUG FIXES:

  - Quote keys to StringBlockEditor so keys with spaces, parens, and
    so on work properly.
  - When there is no route to host for SSH, re-establish a new connection.
  - `vagrant package` once again works, no more nil error. [GH-1423]
  - Human friendly error when "metadata.json" is missing in a box.
  - Don't use the full path to the manifest file with the Puppet provisioner
    because it exposes a bug with Puppet path lookup on VMware.
  - Fix bug in VirtualBox provider where port forwarding just didn't work if
    you attempted to forward to a port under 1024. [GH-1421]
  - Fix cross-device box adds for Windows. [GH-1424]
  - Fix minor issues with defaults of configuration of the shell
    provisioner.
  - Fix Puppet server using "host_name" instead of "hostname" [GH-1444]
  - Raise a proper error if no hostonly network is found for NFS with
    VirtualBox. [GH-1437]

## 1.1.0 (March 14, 2013)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  - Vagrantfiles from 1.0.x that _do not use_ any plugins are fully
    backwards compatible. If plugins are used, they must be removed prior
    to upgrading. The new plugin system in place will avoid this issue in
    the future.
  - Lots of changes introduced in the form of a new configuration version and
    format, but this is _opt-in_. Old Vagrantfile format continues to be supported,
    as promised. To use the new features that will be introduced throughout
    the 1.x series, you'll have to upgrade at some point.

FEATURES:

  - Groundwork for **providers**, alternate backends for Vagrant that
    allow Vagrant to power systems other than VirtualBox. Much improvement
    and change will come to this throughout the 1.x lifecycle. The API
    will continue to change, features will be added, and more. Specifically,
    a revamped system for handling shared folders gracefully across providers
    will be introduced in a future release.
  - New plugin system which adds much more structure and stability to
    the overall API. The goal of this system is to make it easier to write
    powerful plugins for Vagrant while providing a backwards-compatible API
    so that plugins will always _load_ (though they will almost certainly
    not be _functional_ in future versions of Vagrant).
  - Plugins are now installed and managed using the `vagrant plugin` interface.
  - Allow "file://" URLs for box URLs. [GH-1087]
  - Emit "vagrant-mount" upstart event when NFS shares are mounted. [GH-1118]
  - Add a VirtualBox provider config `auto_nat_dns_proxy` which when set to
    false will not attempt to automatically manage NAT DNS proxy settings
    with VirtualBox. [GH-1313]
  - `vagrant provision` accepts the `--provision-with` flag [GH-1167]
  - Set the name of VirtualBox machines with `virtualbox.name` in the
    VirtualBox provider config. [GH-1126]
  - `vagrant ssh` will execute an `ssh` binary on Windows if it is on
    your PATH. [GH-933]
  - The environmental variable `VAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE` can be used to
    specify an alternate Vagrantfile filename.

IMPROVEMENTS / BUG FIXES:

  - Vagrant works much better in Cygwin environments on Windows by
    properly resolving Cygwin paths. [GH-1366]
  - Improve the SSH "ready?" check by more gracefully handling timeouts. [GH-841]
  - Human friendly error if connection times out for HTTP downloads. [GH-849]
  - Detect when the VirtualBox installation is incomplete and error. [GH-846]
  - Detect when kernel modules for VirtualBox need to be installed on Gentoo
    systems and report a user-friendly error. [GH-710]
  - All `vagrant` commands that can take a target VM name can take one even
    if you're not in a multi-VM environment. [GH-894]
  - Hostname is set before networks are setup to avoid very slow `sudo`
    speeds on CentOS. [GH-922]
  - `config.ssh.shell` now includes the flags to pass to it, such as `-l` [GH-917]
  - The check for whether a port is open or not is more complete by
    catching ENETUNREACH errors. [GH-948]
  - SSH uses LogLevel FATAL so that errors are still shown.
  - Sending a SIGINT (Ctrl-C) very early on when executing `vagrant` no
    longer results in an ugly stack trace.
  - Chef JSON configuration output is now pretty-printed to be
    human readable. [GH-1146]
    that SSHing succeeds when booting a machine.
  - VMs in the "guru meditation" state can be destroyed now using
    `vagrant destroy`.
  - Fix issue where changing SSH key permissions didn't properly work. [GH-911]
  - Fix issue where Vagrant didn't properly detect VBoxManage on Windows
    if VBOX_INSTALL_PATH contained multiple paths. [GH-885]
  - Fix typo in setting host name for Gentoo guests. [GH-931]
  - Files that are included with `vagrant package --include` now properly
    preserve file attributes on earlier versions of Ruby. [GH-951]
  - Multiple interfaces now work with Arch linux guests. [GH-957]
  - Fix issue where subprocess execution would always spin CPU of Ruby
    process to 100%. [GH-832]
  - Fix issue where shell provisioner would sometimes never end. [GH-968]
  - Fix issue where puppet would reorder module paths. [GH-964]
  - When console input is asked for (destroying a VM, bridged interfaces, etc.),
    keystrokes such as ctrl-D and ctrl-C are more gracefully handled. [GH-1017]
  - Fixed bug where port check would use "localhost" on systems where
    "localhost" is not available. [GH-1057]
  - Add missing translation for "saving" state on VirtualBox. [GH-1110]
  - Proper error message if the remote end unexpectedly resets the connection
    while downloading a box over HTTP. [GH-1090]
  - Human-friendly error is raised if there are permission issues when
    using SCP to upload files. [GH-924]
  - Box adding doesn't use `/tmp` anymore which can avoid some cross-device
    copy issues. [GH-1199]
  - Vagrant works properly in folders with strange characters. [GH-1223]
  - Vagrant properly handles "paused" VirtualBox machines. [GH-1184]
  - Better behavior around permissions issues when copying insecure
    private key. [GH-580]

## 1.0.7 (March 13, 2013)

  - Detect if a newer version of Vagrant ran and error if it did,
    because we're not forward-compatible.
  - Check for guest additions version AFTER booting. [GH-1179]
  - Quote IdentityFile in `ssh-config` so private keys with spaces in
    the path work. [GH-1322]
  - Fix issue where multiple Puppet module paths can be re-ordered [GH-964]
  - Shell provisioner won't hang on Windows anymore due to unclosed
    tempfile. [GH-1040]
  - Retry setting default VM name, since it sometimes fails first time. [GH-1368]
  - Support setting hostname on Suse [GH-1063]

## 1.0.6 (December 21, 2012)

  - Shell provisioner outputs proper line endings on Windows [GH-1164]
  - SSH upload opens file to stream which fixes strange upload issues.
  - Check for proper exit codes for Puppet, since multiple exit codes
    can mean success. [GH-1180]
  - Fix issue where DNS doesn't resolve properly for 12.10. [GH-1176]
  - Allow hostname to be a substring of the box name for Ubuntu [GH-1163]
  - Use `puppet agent` instead of `puppetd` to be Puppet 3.x
    compatible. [GH-1169]
  - Work around bug in VirtualBox exposed by bug in OS X 10.8 where
    VirtualBox executables couldn't handle garbage being injected into
    stdout by OS X.

## 1.0.5 (September 18, 2012)

  - Work around a critical bug in VirtualBox 4.2.0 on Windows that
    causes Vagrant to not work. [GH-1130]
  - Plugin loading works better on Windows by using the proper
    file path separator.
  - NFS works on Fedora 16+. [GH-1140]
  - NFS works with newer versions of Arch hosts that use systemd. [GH-1142]

## 1.0.4 (September 13, 2012)

  - VirtualBox 4.2 driver. [GH-1120]
  - Correct `ssh-config` help to use `--host`, not `-h`.
  - Use "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost" for port checking to fix problem
    where "localhost" is not properly setup. [GH-1057]
  - Disable read timeout on Net::HTTP to avoid `rbuf_fill` error. [GH-1072]
  - Retry SSH on `EHOSTUNREACH` errors.
  - Add missing translation for "saving" state. [GH-1110]

## 1.0.3 (May 1, 2012)

  - Don't enable NAT DNS proxy on machines where resolv.conf already points
    to localhost. This allows Vagrant to work once again with Ubuntu
    12.04. [GH-909]

## 1.0.2 (March 25, 2012)

  - Provisioners will still mount folders and such if `--no-provision` is
    used, so that `vagrant provision` works. [GH-803]
  - Nicer error message if an unsupported SSH key type is used. [GH-805]
  - Gentoo guests can now have their host names changed. [GH-796]
  - Relative paths can be used for the `config.ssh.private_key_path`
    setting. [GH-808]
  - `vagrant ssh` now works on Solaris, where `IdentitiesOnly` was not
    an available option. [GH-820]
  - Output works properly in the face of broken pipes. [GH-819]
  - Enable Host IO Cache on the SATA controller by default.
  - Chef-solo provisioner now supports encrypted data bags. [GH-816]
  - Enable the NAT DNS proxy by default, allowing your DNS to continue
    working when you switch networks. [GH-834]
  - Checking for port forwarding collisions also checks for other applications
    that are potentially listening on that port as well. [GH-821]
  - Multiple VM names can be specified for the various commands now. For
    example: `vagrant up web db service`. [GH-795]
  - More robust error handling if a VM fails to boot. The error message
    is much clearer now. [GH-825]

## 1.0.1 (March 11, 2012)

  - Installers are now bundled with Ruby 1.9.3p125. Previously they were
    bundled with 1.9.3p0. This actually fixes some IO issues with Windows.
  - Windows installer now outputs a `vagrant` binary that will work in msys
    or Cygwin environments.
  - Fix crashing issue which manifested itself in multi-VM environments.
  - Add missing `rubygems` require in `environment.rb` to avoid
    possible load errors. [GH-781]
  - `vagrant destroy` shows a nice error when called without a
    TTY (and hence can't confirm). [GH-779]
  - Fix an issue with the `:vagrantfile_name` option to `Vagrant::Environment`
    not working properly. [GH-778]
  - `VAGRANT_CWD` environmental variable can be used to set the CWD to
    something other than the current directory.
  - Downloading boxes from servers that don't send a content-length
    now works properly. [GH-788]
  - The `:facter` option now works for puppet server. [GH-790]
  - The `--no-provision` and `--provision-with` flags are available to
    `vagrant reload` now.
  - `:openbsd` guest which supports only halting at the moment. [GH-773]
  - `ssh-config -h` now shows help, instead of assuming a host is being
    specified. For host, you can still use `--host`. [GH-793]

## 1.0.0 (March 6, 2012)

  - `vagrant gem` should now be used to install Vagrant plugins that are
    gems. This installs the gems to a private gem folder that Vagrant adds
    to its own load path. This isolates Vagrant-related gems from system
    gems.
  - Plugin loading no longer happens right when Vagrant is loaded, but when
    a Vagrant environment is loaded. I don't anticipate this causing any
    problems but it is a backwards incompatible change should a plugin
    depend on this (but I don't see any reason why they would).
  - `vagrant destroy` now asks for confirmation by default. This can be
    overridden with the `--force` flag. [GH-699]
  - Fix issue with Puppet config inheritance. [GH-722]
  - Fix issue where starting a VM on some systems was incorrectly treated
    as failing. [GH-720]
  - It is now an error to specify the packaging `output` as a directory. [GH-730]
  - Unix-style line endings are used properly for guest OS. [GH-727]
  - Retry certain VirtualBox operations, since they intermittently fail.
    [GH-726]
  - Fix issue where Vagrant would sometimes "lose" a VM if an exception
    occurred. [GH-725]
  - `vagrant destroy` destroys virtual machines in reverse order. [GH-739]
  - Add an `fsid` option to Linux NFS exports. [GH-736]
  - Fix edge case where an exception could be raised in networking code. [GH-742]
  - Add missing translation for the "guru meditation" state. [GH-745]

  - Fix crashing case if there are no ports to forward.
  - Fix issue surrounding improper configuration of host only networks on
    RedHat guests. [GH-719]

    "cookbooks" folder in their directory. [GH-638]
  - Fix `forward_agent` not working when outside of blocks. [GH-651]
  - Fix issue causing custom guest implementations to not load properly.
  - Filter clear screen character out of output on SSH.
  - Log output now goes on `stderr`, since it is utility information.
  - Get rid of case where a `NoMethodError` could be raised while

## 0.9.0 (January 17, 2012)

  - VirtualBox 4.0 support backported in addition to supporting VirtualBox 4.1.
  - `config.vm.network` syntax changed so that the first argument is now the type
    of argument. Previously where you had `config.vm.network "33.33.33.10"` you
    should now put `config.vm.network :hostonly, "33.33.33.10"`. This is in order
    to support bridged networking, as well.
  - `config.vm.forward_port` no longer requires a name parameter.
  - Bridged networking. `config.vm.network` with `:bridged` as the option will
    setup a bridged network.
  - Host only networks can be configured with DHCP now. Specify `:dhcp` as
    the IP and it will be done.
  - `config.vm.customize` now takes a command to send to `VBoxManage`, so any
    arbitrary command can be sent. The older style of passing a block no longer
    works and Vagrant will give a proper error message if it notices this old-style
    being used.
  - `config.ssh.forwarded_port_key` is gone. Vagrant no longer cares about
    forwarded port names for any reason. Please use `config.ssh.guest_port`
    (more below).
  - `config.ssh.forwarded_port_destination` has been replaced by
    `config.ssh.guest_port` which more accurately reflects what it is
    used for. Vagrant will automatically scan forwarded ports that match the
    guest port to find the SSH port.
  - Logging. The entire Vagrant source has had logging sprinkled throughout
    to make debugging issues easier. To enable logging, set the VAGRANT_LOG
    environmental variable to the log level you wish to see. By default,
    logging is silent.
  - `system` renamed to `guest` throughout the source. Any `config.vm.system`
    configurations must be changed to `config.vm.guest`
  - Puppet provisioner no longer defaults manifest to "box.pp." Instead, it
    is now "default.pp"
  - All Vagrant commands that take a VM name in a Multi-VM environment
    can now be given a regular expression. If the name starts and ends with a "/"
    then it is assumed to be a regular expression. [GH-573]
  - Added a "--plain" flag to `vagrant ssh` which will cause Vagrant to not
    perform any authentication. It will simply `ssh` into the proper IP and
    port of the virtual machine.
  - If a shared folder now has a `:create` flag set to `true`, the path on the
    host will be created if it doesn't exist.
  - Added `--force` flag to `box add`, which will overwite any existing boxes
    if they exist. [GH-631]
  - Added `--provision-with` to `up` which configures what provisioners run,
    by shortcut. [GH-367]
  - Arbitrary mount options can be passed with `:extra` to any shared
    folders. [GH-551]
  - Options passed after a `--` to `vagrant ssh` are now passed directly to
    `ssh`. [GH-554]
  - Ubuntu guests will now emit a `vagrant-mounted` upstart event after shared
    folders are mounted.
  - `attempts` is a new option on chef client and chef solo provisioners. This
    will run the provisioner multiple times until erroring about failing
    convergence. [GH-282]
  - Removed Thor as a dependency for the command line interfaces. This resulted
    in general speed increases across all command line commands.
  - Linux uses `shutdown -h` instead of `halt` to hopefully more consistently
    power off the system. [GH-575]
  - Tweaks to SSH to hopefully be more reliable in coming up.
  - Helpful error message when SCP is unavailable in the guest. [GH-568]
  - Error message for improperly packaged box files. [GH-198]
  - Copy insecure private key to user-owned directory so even
    `sudo` installed Vagrant installations work. [GH-580]
  - Provisioner stdout/stderr is now color coded based on stdout/stderr.
    stdout is green, stderr is red. [GH-595]
  - Chef solo now prompts users to run a `reload` if shared folders
    are not found on the VM. [GH-253]
  - "--no-provision" once again works for certain commands. [GH-591]
  - Resuming a VM from a saved state will show an error message if there
    would be port collisions. [GH-602]
  - `vagrant ssh -c` will now exit with the same exit code as the command
    run. [GH-598]
  - `vagrant ssh -c` will now send stderr to stderr and stdout to stdout
    on the host machine, instead of all output to stdout.
  - `vagrant box add` path now accepts unexpanded shell paths such as
    `~/foo` and will properly expand them. [GH-633]
  - Vagrant can now be interrupted during the "importing" step.
  - NFS exports will no longer be cleared when an expected error occurs. [GH-577]

## 0.8.10 (December 10, 2011)

  - Revert the SSH tweaks made in 0.8.8. It affected stability

## 0.8.8 (December 1, 2011)

    available. [GH-556]
  - NFS should work for FreeBSD hosts now. [GH-510]
  - SSH executed methods respect `config.ssh.max_tries`. [GH-508]
  - `vagrant box add` now respects the "no_proxy" environmental variable.
    [GH-502]
  - Tweaks that should make "Waiting for VM to boot" slightly more
    reliable.

  - `vagrant ssh-config` now outputs the configured `config.ssh.host`

## 0.7.0 (January 19, 2011)

  - VirtualBox 4.0 support. Support for VirtualBox 3.2 is _dropped_, since

  - Provisioners are now RVM-friendly, meaning if you installed chef or puppet
    with an RVM managed Ruby, Vagrant now finds then. [GH-254]
  - Changed the unused host only network destroy mechanism to check for
    uselessness after the VM is destroyed. This should result in more accurate
    checks.
  - Networks are no longer disabled upon halt/destroy. With the above
    change, its unnecessary.
  - Puppet supports `module_path` configuration to mount local modules directory
    as a shared folder and configure puppet with it. [GH-270]
  - `ssh-config` now outputs `127.0.0.1` as the host instead of `localhost`.

## 0.6.9 (December 21, 2010)

  - Puppet provisioner. [GH-223]

  - Add missing translation for chef binary missing. [GH-203]
  - Fix default settings for Opscode platform and comments. [GH-213]
  - Blank client name for chef server now uses FQDN by default, instead of "client" [GH-214]

    chef server is enabled). [GH-214]
  - Multiple NFS folders now work on linux. [GH-215]
  - Add translation for state "stuck" which is very rare. [GH-218]
  - virtualbox gem dependency minimum raised to 0.7.6 to verify FFI < 1.0.0 is used.
  - Fix issue where box downloading from `vagrant up` didn't reload the box collection. [GH-229]

## 0.6.7 (November 3, 2010)

  - Added validation to verify that a box is specified.
  - Proper error message when box is not found for `config.vm.box`. [GH-195]

    from ever happening again.
  - Properly load sub-VM configuration on first-pass of config loading. Solves
    a LOT of problems with multi-VM. [GH-166] [GH-181]
  - Configuration now only validates on final Vagrantfile proc, so multi-VM
    validates correctly.
  - A nice error message is given if ".vagrant" is a directory and therefore
    can't be accessed. [GH-172]
  - Fix plugin loading in a Rails 2.3.x project. [GH-176]

  - Default VM name is now properly the parent folder of the working directory
    of the environment.
  - Added method to `TestHelpers` to assist with testing new downloaders.
  - `up --no-provision` works again. This disables provisioning during the

  - Initial Vagrantfile is now heavily commented with various available
    options. [GH-171]
  - Box add checks if a box already exists before the download. [GH-170]

    which was causing a stack trace during recovery. [related to GH-166]
  - Basic validation added for Chef configuration (both solo and server).
  - Top config class is now available in all `Vagrant::Config::Base`
    subclasses, which is useful for config validation.
  - Subcommand help shows proper full command in task listing. [GH-168]

  - SSH gives proper error message if VM is not running. [GH-167]
  - Fix some issues with undefined constants in command errors.

## 0.6.1, 0.6.2, 0.6.3 (September 27, 2010)

A lot of quick releases which all were to fix issues with Ruby 1.8.7
compatibility.

## 0.6.0 (September 27, 2010)

  - VM name now defaults to the name of the containing folder, plus a timestamp.
    This should make it easier to identify VMs in the VirtualBox GUI.
  - Exposed Vagrant test helpers in `Vagrant::TestHelpers` for plugins to easily
    test themselves against Vagrant environments.
  - **Plugins** have landed. Plugins are simply gems which have a `vagrant_init.rb`
    file somewhere in their load path. Please read the documentation on
    vagrantup.com before attempting to create a plugin (which is very easy)
    for more information on how it all works and also some guidelines.
  - `vagrant package` now takes a `--vagrantfile` option to specify a
    Vagrantfile to package. The `--include` approach for including a Vagrantfile
    no longer works (previously built boxes will continue to work).
  - `vagrant package` has new logic with regards to the `--include` option
    depending on if the file path is relative or absolute (they can be
    intermixed):
      * _Relative_ paths are copied directly into the box, preserving
        their path. So `--include lib/foo` would be in the box as "lib/foo"
      * _Absolute_ paths are simply copied files into the root of the
        box. So `--include /lib/foo` would be in the box as "foo"
  - "vagrant_main" is no longer the default run list. Instead, chef
    run list starts empty. It is up to you to specify all recipes in
    the Vagrantfile now.
  - Fixed various issues with certain action middleware not working if
    the VM was not created.
  - SSH connection is retried 5 times if there is a connection refused.
    Related to GH-140.
  - If `http_proxy` environmental variable is set, it will be used as the proxy
    box adding via http.
  - Remove `config.ssh.password`. It hasn't been used for a few versions
    now and was only kept around to avoid exceptions in Vagrantfiles.
  - Configuration is now validated so improper input can be found in
    Vagrantfiles.
  - Fixed issue with not detecting Vagrantfile at root directory ("/").
  - Vagrant now gives a nice error message if there is a syntax error
    in any Vagrantfile. [GH-154]
  - The format of the ".vagrant" file which stores persisted VMs has
    changed. This is **backwards incompatible**. Will provide an upgrade
    utility prior to 0.6 launch.
  - Every [expected] Vagrant error now exits with a clean error message
    and a unique exit status, and raises a unique exception (if you're
    scripting Vagrant).
  - Added I18n gem dependency for pulling strings into clean YML files.
    Vagrant is now localizable as a side effect! Translations welcome.
  - Fixed issue with "Waiting for cleanup" message appearing twice in
    some cases. [GH-145]
  - Converted CLI to use Thor. As a tradeoff, there are some backwards
    incompatibilities:
      * `vagrant package` - The `--include` flag now separates filenames
        by spaces, instead of by commas. e.g. `vagrant package --include x y z`
      * `vagrant ssh` - If you specify a command to execute using the `--execute`
        flag, you may now only specify one command (before you were able to
        specify an arbitrary amount). e.g. `vagrant ssh -e "echo hello"`
      * `vagrant ssh-config` has become `vagrant ssh_config` due to a limitation
        in Thor.

## 0.5.4 (September 7, 2010)

  - Fix issue with the "exec failed" by running on Tiger as well.
  - Give an error when downloading a box which already exists prior
    to actually downloading the box.

## 0.5.3 (August 23, 2010)

  - Add erubis as a dependency since its rendering of `erb` is sane.
  - Fixed poorly formatted Vagrantfile after `vagrant init`. [GH-142]
  - Fixed NFS not working properly with multiple NFS folders.
  - Fixed chef solo provision to work on Windows. It was expanding a linux
    path which prepended a drive letter onto it.

## 0.5.2 (August 3, 2010)

  - `vagrant up` can be used as a way to resume the VM as well (same as
    `vagrant resume`). [GH-134]
  - Sudo uses "-E" flag to preserve environment for chef provisioners.
    This fixes issues with CentOS. [GH-133]
  - Added "IdentitiesOnly yes" to options when `vagrant ssh` is run to
    avoid "Too Many Authentication Failures" error. [GH-131]
  - Fix regression with `package` not working. [GH-132]
  - Added ability to specify box url in `init`, which populates the
    Vagrantfile with the proper `config.vm.box_url`.

## 0.5.1 (July 31, 2010)

  - Allow specifying cookbook paths which exist only on the VM in `config.chef.cookbooks_path`.
    This is used for specifying cookbook paths when `config.chef.recipe_url` is used. [GH-130]
    See updated chef solo documentation for more information on this.
  - No longer show "Disabling host only networks..." if no host only networks
    are destroyed. Quiets `destroy`, `halt`, etc output a bit.
  - Updated getting started guide to be more up to date and generic. [GH-125]
  - Fixed error with doing a `vagrant up` when no Vagrantfile existed. [GH-128]
  - Fixed NFS erroring when NFS wasn't even enabled if `/etc/exports` doesn't
    exist. [GH-126]
  - Fixed `vagrant resume` to properly resume a suspended VM. [GH-122]
  - Fixed `halt`, `destroy`, `reload` to where they failed if the VM was
    in a saved state. [GH-123]
  - Added `config.chef.recipe_url` which allows you to specify a URL to
    a gzipped tar file for chef solo to download cookbooks. See the
    [chef-solo docs](https://docs.chef.io/chef_solo.html) for more information.
    [GH-121]
  - Added `vagrant box repackage` which repackages boxes which have
    been added. This is useful in case you want to redistribute a base
    box you have but may have lost the actual "box" file. [GH-120]
