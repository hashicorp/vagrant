## 1.1.0 (unreleased)

  - New plugin system which adds much more structure and stability to
    the overall API. The goal of this system is to make it easier to write
    powerful plugins for Vagrant while providing a backwards-compatible API
    so that plugins will always _load_ (though they will almost certainly
    not be _functional_ in future versions of Vagrant).
  - Improve the SSH "ready?" check. [GH-841]
  - Human friendly error if connection times out for HTTP downloads. [GH-849]
  - Detect when the VirtualBox installation is incomplete and error. [GH-846]
  - Use `LogLevel QUIET` for SSH to suppress the known hosts warning. [GH-847]
  - VMs in the "guru meditation" state can be destroyed now using
    `vagrant destroy`.

## 1.0.2 (March 25, 2012)

  - Provisioners will still mount folders and such if `--no-provision` is
    used, so that `vagrant provision` works. [GH-803]
  - Nicer error message if an unsupported SSH key type is used. [GH-805]
  - Gentoo guests can now have their host names changed. [GH-796]
  - Relative paths can be used for the `config.ssh.private_key_path`
    setting. [GH-808]
  - `vagrant ssh` now works on Solaris, where `IdentitiesOnly` was not
    an available option. [GH-820]
  - Output works properly in the face of broken pipes. [GH-819]
  - Enable Host IO Cache on the SATA controller by default.
  - Chef-solo provisioner now supports encrypted data bags. [GH-816]
  - Enable the NAT DNS proxy by default, allowing your DNS to continue
    working when you switch networks. [GH-834]
  - Checking for port forwarding collisions also checks for other applications
    that are potentially listening on that port as well. [GH-821]
  - Multiple VM names can be specified for the various commands now. For
    example: `vagrant up web db service`. [GH-795]
  - More robust error handling if a VM fails to boot. The error message
    is much clearer now. [GH-825]

## 1.0.1 (March 11, 2012)

  - Installers are now bundled with Ruby 1.9.3p125. Previously they were
    bundled with 1.9.3p0. This actually fixes some IO issues with Windows.
  - Windows installer now outputs a `vagrant` binary that will work in msys
    or Cygwin environments.
  - Fix crashing issue which manifested itself in multi-VM environments.
  - Add missing `rubygems` require in `environment.rb` to avoid
    possible load errors. [GH-781]
  - `vagrant destroy` shows a nice error when called without a
    TTY (and hence can't confirm). [GH-779]
  - Fix an issue with the `:vagrantfile_name` option to `Vagrant::Environment`
    not working properly. [GH-778]
  - `VAGRANT_CWD` environmental variable can be used to set the CWD to
    something other than the current directory.
  - Downloading boxes from servers that don't send a content-length
    now works properly. [GH-788]
  - The `:facter` option now works for puppet server. [GH-790]
  - The `--no-provision` and `--provision-with` flags are available to
    `vagrant reload` now.
  - `:openbsd` guest which supports only halting at the moment. [GH-773]
  - `ssh-config -h` now shows help, instead of assuming a host is being
    specified. For host, you can still use `--host`. [GH-793]

## 1.0.0 (March 6, 2012)

  - `vagrant gem` should now be used to install Vagrant plugins that are
    gems. This installs the gems to a private gem folder that Vagrant adds
    to its own load path. This isolates Vagrant-related gems from system
    gems.
  - Plugin loading no longer happens right when Vagrant is loaded, but when
    a Vagrant environment is loaded. I don't anticipate this causing any
    problems but it is a backwards incompatible change should a plugin
    depend on this (but I don't see any reason why they would).
  - `vagrant destroy` now asks for confirmation by default. This can be
    overridden with the `--force` flag. [GH-699]
  - Fix issue with Puppet config inheritance. [GH-722]
  - Fix issue where starting a VM on some systems was incorrectly treated
    as failing. [GH-720]
  - It is now an error to specify the packaging `output` as a directory. [GH-730]
  - Unix-style line endings are used properly for guest OS. [GH-727]
  - Retry certain VirtualBox operations, since they intermittently fail.
    [GH-726]
  - Fix issue where Vagrant would sometimes "lose" a VM if an exception
    occurred. [GH-725]
  - `vagrant destroy` destroys virtual machines in reverse order. [GH-739]
  - Add an `fsid` option to Linux NFS exports. [GH-736]
  - Fix edge case where an exception could be raised in networking code. [GH-742]
  - Add missing translation for the "guru meditation" state. [GH-745]
  - Check that VirtualBox exists before certain commands. [GH-746]
  - NIC type can be defined for host-only network adapters. [GH-750]
  - Fix issue where re-running chef-client would sometimes cause
    problems due to file permissions. [GH-748]
  - FreeBSD guests can now have their hostnames changed. [GH-757]
  - FreeBSD guests now support host only networking and bridged networking. [GH-762]
  - `VM#run_action` is now public so plugin-devs can hook into it.
  - Fix crashing bug when attempting to run commands on the "primary"
    VM in a multi-VM environment. [GH-761]
  - With puppet you can now specify `:facter` as a dictionary of facts to
    override what is generated by Puppet. [GH-753]
  - Automatically convert all arguments to `customize` to strings.
  - openSUSE host system. [GH-766]
  - Fix subprocess IO deadlock which would occur on Windows. [GH-765]
  - Fedora 16 guest support. [GH-772]

## 0.9.7 (February 9, 2012)

  - Fix regression where all subprocess IO simply didn't work with
    Windows. [GH-721]

## 0.9.6 (February 7, 2012)

  - Fix strange issue with inconsistent childprocess reads on JRuby. [GH-711]
  - `vagrant ssh` does a direct `exec()` syscall now instead of going through
    the shell. This makes it so things like shell expansion oddities no longer
    cause problems. [GH-715]
  - Fix crashing case if there are no ports to forward.
  - Fix issue surrounding improper configuration of host only networks on
    RedHat guests. [GH-719]
  - NFS should work properly on Gentoo. [GH-706]

## 0.9.5 (February 5, 2012)

  - Fix crashing case when all network options are `:auto_config false`.
    [GH-689]
  - Type of network adapter can be specified with `:nic_type`. [GH-690]
  - The NFS version can be specified with the `:nfs_version` option
    on shared folders. [GH-557]
  - Greatly improved FreeBSD guest and host support. [GH-695]
  - Fix instability with RedHat guests and host only and bridged networks.
    [GH-698]
  - When using bridged networking, only list the network interfaces
    that are up as choices. [GH-701]
  - More intelligent handling of the `certname` option for puppet
    server. [GH-702]
  - You may now explicitly set the network to bridge to in the Vagrantfile
    using the `:bridge` parameter. [GH-655]

## 0.9.4 (January 28, 2012)

  - Important internal changes to middlewares that make plugin developer's
    lives much easier. [GH-684]
  - Match VM names that have parens, brackets, etc.
  - Detect when the VirtualBox kernel module is not loaded and error. [GH-677]
  - Set `:auto_config` to false on any networking option to not automatically
    configure it on the guest. [GH-663]
  - NFS shared folder guest paths can now contain shell expansion characters
    such as `~`.
  - NFS shared folders with a `:create` flag will have their host folders
    properly created if they don't exist. [GH-667]
  - Fix the precedence for Arch, Ubuntu, and FreeBSD host classes so
    they are properly detected. [GH-683]
  - Fix issue where VM import sometimes made strange VirtualBox folder
    layouts. [GH-669]
  - Call proper `id` command on Solaris. [GH-679]
  - More accurate VBoxManage error detection.
  - Shared folders can now be marked as transient using the `:transient`
    flag. [GH-688]

## 0.9.3 (January 24, 2012)

  - Proper error handling for not enough arguments to `box` commands.
  - Fix issue causing crashes with bridged networking. [GH-673]
  - Ignore host only network interfaces that are "down." [GH-675]
  - Use "printf" instead of "echo" to determine shell expanded files paths
    which is more generally POSIX compliant. [GH-676]

## 0.9.2 (January 20, 2012)

  - Support shell expansions in shared folder guest paths again. [GH-656]
  - Fix issue where Chef solo always expected the host to have a
    "cookbooks" folder in their directory. [GH-638]
  - Fix `forward_agent` not working when outside of blocks. [GH-651]
  - Fix issue causing custom guest implementations to not load properly.
  - Filter clear screen character out of output on SSH.
  - Log output now goes on `stderr`, since it is utility information.
  - Get rid of case where a `NoMethodError` could be raised while
    determining VirtualBox version. [GH-658]
  - Debian/Ubuntu uses `ifdown` again, instead of `ifconfig xxx down`, since
    the behavior seems different/wrong.
  - Give a nice error if `:vagrant` is used as a JSON key, since Vagrant
    uses this. [GH-661]
  - If there is only one bridgable interface, use that without asking
    the user. [GH-655]
  - The shell will have color output if ANSICON is installed on Windows. [GH-666]

## 0.9.1 (January 18, 2012)

  - Use `ifconfig device down` instead of `ifdown`. [GH-649]
  - Clearer invalid log level error. [GH-645]
  - Fix exception raised with NFS `recover` method.
  - Fix `ui` `NoMethodError` exception in puppet server.
  - Fix `vagrant box help` on Ruby 1.8.7. [GH-647]

## 0.9.0 (January 17, 2012)

  - VirtualBox 4.0 support backported in addition to supporting VirtualBox 4.1.
  - `config.vm.network` syntax changed so that the first argument is now the type
    of argument. Previously where you had `config.vm.network "33.33.33.10"` you
    should now put `config.vm.network :hostonly, "33.33.33.10"`. This is in order
    to support bridged networking, as well.
  - `config.vm.forward_port` no longer requires a name parameter.
  - Bridged networking. `config.vm.network` with `:bridged` as the option will
    setup a bridged network.
  - Host only networks can be configured with DHCP now. Specify `:dhcp` as
    the IP and it will be done.
  - `config.vm.customize` now takes a command to send to `VBoxManage`, so any
    arbitrary command can be sent. The older style of passing a block no longer
    works and Vagrant will give a proper error message if it notices this old-style
    being used.
  - `config.ssh.forwarded_port_key` is gone. Vagrant no longer cares about
    forwarded port names for any reason. Please use `config.ssh.guest_port`
    (more below).
  - `config.ssh.forwarded_port_destination` has been replaced by
    `config.ssh.guest_port` which more accurately reflects what it is
    used for. Vagrant will automatically scan forwarded ports that match the
    guest port to find the SSH port.
  - Logging. The entire Vagrant source has had logging sprinkled throughout
    to make debugging issues easier. To enable logging, set the VAGRANT_LOG
    environmental variable to the log level you wish to see. By default,
    logging is silent.
  - `system` renamed to `guest` throughout the source. Any `config.vm.system`
    configurations must be changed to `config.vm.guest`
  - Puppet provisioner no longer defaults manifest to "box.pp." Instead, it
    is now "default.pp"
  - All Vagrant commands that take a VM name in a Multi-VM environment
    can now be given a regular expression. If the name starts and ends with a "/"
    then it is assumed to be a regular expression. [GH-573]
  - Added a "--plain" flag to `vagrant ssh` which will cause Vagrant to not
    perform any authentication. It will simply `ssh` into the proper IP and
    port of the virtual machine.
  - If a shared folder now has a `:create` flag set to `true`, the path on the
    host will be created if it doesn't exist.
  - Added `--force` flag to `box add`, which will overwite any existing boxes
    if they exist. [GH-631]
  - Added `--provision-with` to `up` which configures what provisioners run,
    by shortcut. [GH-367]
  - Arbitrary mount options can be passed with `:extra` to any shared
    folders. [GH-551]
  - Options passed after a `--` to `vagrant ssh` are now passed directly to
    `ssh`. [GH-554]
  - Ubuntu guests will now emit a `vagrant-mounted` upstart event after shared
    folders are mounted.
  - `attempts` is a new option on chef client and chef solo provisioners. This
    will run the provisioner multiple times until erroring about failing
    convergence. [GH-282]
  - Removed Thor as a dependency for the command line interfaces. This resulted
    in general speed increases across all command line commands.
  - Linux uses `shutdown -h` instead of `halt` to hopefully more consistently
    power off the system. [GH-575]
  - Tweaks to SSH to hopefully be more reliable in coming up.
  - Helpful error message when SCP is unavailable in the guest. [GH-568]
  - Error message for improperly packaged box files. [GH-198]
  - Copy insecure private key to user-owned directory so even
    `sudo` installed Vagrant installations work. [GH-580]
  - Provisioner stdout/stderr is now color coded based on stdout/stderr.
    stdout is green, stderr is red. [GH-595]
  - Chef solo now prompts users to run a `reload` if shared folders
    are not found on the VM. [GH-253]
  - "--no-provision" once again works for certain commands. [GH-591]
  - Resuming a VM from a saved state will show an error message if there
    would be port collisions. [GH-602]
  - `vagrant ssh -c` will now exit with the same exit code as the command
    run. [GH-598]
  - `vagrant ssh -c` will now send stderr to stderr and stdout to stdout
    on the host machine, instead of all output to stdout.
  - `vagrant box add` path now accepts unexpanded shell paths such as
    `~/foo` and will properly expand them. [GH-633]
  - Vagrant can now be interrupted during the "importing" step.
  - NFS exports will no longer be cleared when an expected error occurs. [GH-577]

## 0.8.10 (December 10, 2011)

  - Revert the SSH tweaks made in 0.8.8. It affected stability

## 0.8.8 (December 1, 2011)

  - `vagrant init` respects `Vagrant::Environment` cwd. [GH-528]
  - `vagrant` commands will not output color when stdout is
    not a TTY.

  - Chef provisioners no longer depend on a "v-root" share being
    available. [GH-556]
  - NFS should work for FreeBSD hosts now. [GH-510]
  - SSH executed methods respect `config.ssh.max_tries`. [GH-508]
  - `vagrant box add` now respects the "no_proxy" environmental variable.
    [GH-502]
  - Tweaks that should make "Waiting for VM to boot" slightly more
    reliable.
  - Add comments to Vagrantfile to make it detected as Ruby file for
    `vi` and `emacs`. [GH-515]
  - More correct guest addition version checking. [GH-514]
  - Chef solo support on Windows is improved. [GH-542]

 - Arch linux support: host only networks and changing the host name. [GH-439] [GH-448]
 - Chef solo `roles_path` and `data_bags_path` can only be be single paths. [GH-446]
 - Fix `virtualbox_not_detected` error message to require 4.1.x. [GH-458]
 - Add shortname (`hostname -s`) for hostname setting on RHEL systems. [GH-456]
 - `vagrant ssh -c` output no longer has a prefix and respects newlines
   from the output. [GH-462]

## 0.8.2 (July 22, 2011)

  - Fix issue with SSH disconnects not reconnecting.
  - Fix chef solo simply not working with roles/data bags. [GH-425]

    work. [GH-374]
  - Add "--no-color" as an argument and no colorized output will be used. [GH-379]
  - Added DEVICE option to the RedHat host only networking entry, which allows

  - Set the host name of your guest OS with `config.vm.host_name` [GH-273]
  - `vagrant ssh-config` now outputs the configured `config.ssh.host`

## 0.7.0 (January 19, 2011)

  - VirtualBox 4.0 support. Support for VirtualBox 3.2 is _dropped_, since
    the API is so different. Stay with the 0.6.x series if you have VirtualBox
    3.2.x.
  - Puppet server provisioner. [GH-262]
  - Use numeric uid/gid in mounting shared folders to increase portability. [GH-252]

    change is not backwards compatible. [GH-265]
  - Provisioners are now RVM-friendly, meaning if you installed chef or puppet
    with an RVM managed Ruby, Vagrant now finds then. [GH-254]
  - Changed the unused host only network destroy mechanism to check for
    uselessness after the VM is destroyed. This should result in more accurate
    checks.
  - Networks are no longer disabled upon halt/destroy. With the above
    change, its unnecessary.
  - Puppet supports `module_path` configuration to mount local modules directory
    as a shared folder and configure puppet with it. [GH-270]
  - `ssh-config` now outputs `127.0.0.1` as the host instead of `localhost`.

## 0.6.9 (December 21, 2010)

  - Puppet provisioner. [GH-223]
  - Solaris system configurable to use `sudo`.
  - Solaris system registered, so it can be set with `:solaris`.
  - `vagrant package` include can be a directory name, which will cause the
    contents to be recursively copied into the package. [GH-241]
  - Arbitrary options to puppet binary can be set with `config.puppet.options`. [GH-242]
  - BSD hosts use proper GNU sed syntax for clearing NFS shares. [GH-243]
  - Enumerate VMs in a multi-VM environment in order they were defined. [GH-244]
  - Check for VM boot changed to use `timeout` library, which works better with Windows.
  - Show special error if VirtualBox not detected on 64-bit Windows.
  - Show error to Windows users attempting to use host only networking since
    it doesn't work yet.

## 0.6.8 (November 30, 2010)

  - Network interfaces are now up/down in distinct commands instead of just
    restarting "networking." [GH-192]
  - Add missing translation for chef binary missing. [GH-203]
  - Fix default settings for Opscode platform and comments. [GH-213]
  - Blank client name for chef server now uses FQDN by default, instead of "client" [GH-214]
  - Run list can now be nil, which will cause it to sync with chef server (when
    chef server is enabled). [GH-214]
  - Multiple NFS folders now work on linux. [GH-215]
  - Add translation for state "stuck" which is very rare. [GH-218]
  - virtualbox gem dependency minimum raised to 0.7.6 to verify FFI < 1.0.0 is used.
  - Fix issue where box downloading from `vagrant up` didn't reload the box collection. [GH-229]

## 0.6.7 (November 3, 2010)

  - Added validation to verify that a box is specified.
  - Proper error message when box is not found for `config.vm.box`. [GH-195]
  - Fix output of `vagrant status` with multi-vm to be correct. [GH-196]

## 0.6.6 (October 14, 2010)

  - `vagrant status NAME` works once again. [GH-191]
  - Conditional validation of Vagrantfile so that some commands don't validate. [GH-188]
  - Fix "junk" output for ssh-config. [GH-189]
  - Fix port collision handling with greater than two VMs. [GH-185]
  - Fix potential infinite loop with root path if bad CWD is given to environment.

## 0.6.5 (October 8, 2010)

  - Validations on base MAC address to avoid situation described in GH-166, GH-181
    from ever happening again.
  - Properly load sub-VM configuration on first-pass of config loading. Solves
    a LOT of problems with multi-VM. [GH-166] [GH-181]
  - Configuration now only validates on final Vagrantfile proc, so multi-VM
    validates correctly.
  - A nice error message is given if ".vagrant" is a directory and therefore
    can't be accessed. [GH-172]
  - Fix plugin loading in a Rails 2.3.x project. [GH-176]

## 0.6.4 (October 4, 2010)

  - Default VM name is now properly the parent folder of the working directory
    of the environment.
  - Added method to `TestHelpers` to assist with testing new downloaders.
  - `up --no-provision` works again. This disables provisioning during the
    boot process.
  - Action warden doesn't do recovery process on `SystemExit` exceptions,
    allowing the double ctrl-C to work properly again. [related to GH-166]
  - Initial Vagrantfile is now heavily commented with various available
    options. [GH-171]
  - Box add checks if a box already exists before the download. [GH-170]
  - NFS no longer attempts to clean exports file if VM is not created,
    which was causing a stack trace during recovery. [related to GH-166]
  - Basic validation added for Chef configuration (both solo and server).
  - Top config class is now available in all `Vagrant::Config::Base`
    subclasses, which is useful for config validation.
  - Subcommand help shows proper full command in task listing. [GH-168]
  - SSH gives error message if `ssh` binary is not found. [GH-161]
  - SSH gives proper error message if VM is not running. [GH-167]
  - Fix some issues with undefined constants in command errors.

## 0.6.1, 0.6.2, 0.6.3 (September 27, 2010)

A lot of quick releases which all were to fix issues with Ruby 1.8.7
compatibility.

## 0.6.0 (September 27, 2010)

  - VM name now defaults to the name of the containing folder, plus a timestamp.
    This should make it easier to identify VMs in the VirtualBox GUI.
  - Exposed Vagrant test helpers in `Vagrant::TestHelpers` for plugins to easily
    test themselves against Vagrant environments.
  - **Plugins** have landed. Plugins are simply gems which have a `vagrant_init.rb`
    file somewhere in their load path. Please read the documentation on
    vagrantup.com before attempting to create a plugin (which is very easy)
    for more information on how it all works and also some guidelines.
  - `vagrant package` now takes a `--vagrantfile` option to specify a
    Vagrantfile to package. The `--include` approach for including a Vagrantfile
    no longer works (previously built boxes will continue to work).
  - `vagrant package` has new logic with regards to the `--include` option
    depending on if the file path is relative or absolute (they can be
    intermixed):
      * _Relative_ paths are copied directly into the box, preserving
        their path. So `--include lib/foo` would be in the box as "lib/foo"
      * _Absolute_ paths are simply copied files into the root of the
        box. So `--include /lib/foo` would be in the box as "foo"
  - "vagrant_main" is no longer the default run list. Instead, chef
    run list starts empty. It is up to you to specify all recipes in
    the Vagrantfile now.
  - Fixed various issues with certain action middleware not working if
    the VM was not created.
  - SSH connection is retried 5 times if there is a connection refused.
    Related to GH-140.
  - If `http_proxy` environmental variable is set, it will be used as the proxy
    box adding via http.
  - Remove `config.ssh.password`. It hasn't been used for a few versions
    now and was only kept around to avoid exceptions in Vagrantfiles.
  - Configuration is now validated so improper input can be found in
    Vagrantfiles.
  - Fixed issue with not detecting Vagrantfile at root directory ("/").
  - Vagrant now gives a nice error message if there is a syntax error
    in any Vagrantfile. [GH-154]
  - The format of the ".vagrant" file which stores persisted VMs has
    changed. This is **backwards incompatible**. Will provide an upgrade
    utility prior to 0.6 launch.
  - Every [expected] Vagrant error now exits with a clean error message
    and a unique exit status, and raises a unique exception (if you're
    scripting Vagrant).
  - Added I18n gem dependency for pulling strings into clean YML files.
    Vagrant is now localizable as a side effect! Translations welcome.
  - Fixed issue with "Waiting for cleanup" message appearing twice in
    some cases. [GH-145]
  - Converted CLI to use Thor. As a tradeoff, there are some backwards
    incompatibilities:
      * `vagrant package` - The `--include` flag now separates filenames
        by spaces, instead of by commas. e.g. `vagrant package --include x y z`
      * `vagrant ssh` - If you specify a command to execute using the `--execute`
        flag, you may now only specify one command (before you were able to
        specify an arbitrary amount). e.g. `vagrant ssh -e "echo hello"`
      * `vagrant ssh-config` has become `vagrant ssh_config` due to a limitation
        in Thor.

## 0.5.4 (September 7, 2010)

  - Fix issue with the "exec failed" by running on Tiger as well.
  - Give an error when downloading a box which already exists prior
    to actually downloading the box.

## 0.5.3 (August 23, 2010)

  - Add erubis as a dependency since its rendering of `erb` is sane.
  - Fixed poorly formatted Vagrantfile after `vagrant init`. [GH-142]
  - Fixed NFS not working properly with multiple NFS folders.
  - Fixed chef solo provision to work on Windows. It was expanding a linux
    path which prepended a drive letter onto it.

## 0.5.2 (August 3, 2010)

  - `vagrant up` can be used as a way to resume the VM as well (same as
    `vagrant resume`). [GH-134]
  - Sudo uses "-E" flag to preserve environment for chef provisioners.
    This fixes issues with CentOS. [GH-133]
  - Added "IdentitiesOnly yes" to options when `vagrant ssh` is run to
    avoid "Too Many Authentication Failures" error. [GH-131]
  - Fix regression with `package` not working. [GH-132]
  - Added ability to specify box url in `init`, which populates the
    Vagrantfile with the proper `config.vm.box_url`.

## 0.5.1 (July 31, 2010)

  - Allow specifying cookbook paths which exist only on the VM in `config.chef.cookbooks_path`.
    This is used for specifying cookbook paths when `config.chef.recipe_url` is used. [GH-130]
    See updated chef solo documentation for more information on this.
  - No longer show "Disabling host only networks..." if no host only networks
    are destroyed. Quiets `destroy`, `halt`, etc output a bit.
  - Updated getting started guide to be more up to date and generic. [GH-125]
  - Fixed error with doing a `vagrant up` when no Vagrantfile existed. [GH-128]
  - Fixed NFS erroring when NFS wasn't even enabled if `/etc/exports` doesn't
    exist. [GH-126]
  - Fixed `vagrant resume` to properly resume a suspended VM. [GH-122]
  - Fixed `halt`, `destroy`, `reload` to where they failed if the VM was
    in a saved state. [GH-123]
  - Added `config.chef.recipe_url` which allows you to specify a URL to
    a gzipped tar file for chef solo to download cookbooks. See the
    [chef-solo docs](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo#ChefSolo-RunningfromaURL) for more information.
    [GH-121]
  - Added `vagrant box repackage` which repackages boxes which have
    been added. This is useful in case you want to redistribute a base
    box you have but may have lost the actual "box" file. [GH-120]
