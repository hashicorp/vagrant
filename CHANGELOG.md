## 0.6.7 (unreleased)

  - Added validation to verify that a box is specified.
  - Proper error message when box is not found for `config.vm.box`. [GH-195]
  - Fix output of `vagrant status` with multi-vm to be correct. [GH-196]

## 0.6.6 (October 14, 2010)

  - `vagrant status NAME` works once again. [GH-191]
  - Conditional validation of Vagrantfile so that some commands don't validate. [GH-188]
  - Fix "junk" output for ssh-config. [GH-189]
  - Fix port collision handling with greater than two VMs. [GH-185]
  - Fix potential infinite loop with root path if bad CWD is given to environment.

## 0.6.5 (October 8, 2010)

  - Validations on base MAC address to avoid situation described in GH-166, GH-181
    from ever happening again.
  - Properly load sub-VM configuration on first-pass of config loading. Solves
    a LOT of problems with multi-VM. [GH-166] [GH-181]
  - Configuration now only validates on final Vagrantfile proc, so multi-VM
    validates correctly.
  - A nice error message is given if ".vagrant" is a directory and therefore
    can't be accessed. [GH-172]
  - Fix plugin loading in a Rails 2.3.x project. [GH-176]

## 0.6.4 (October 4, 2010)

  - Default VM name is now properly the parent folder of the working directory
    of the environment.
  - Added method to `TestHelpers` to assist with testing new downloaders.
  - `up --no-provision` works again. This disables provisioning during the
    boot process.
  - Action warden doesn't do recovery process on `SystemExit` exceptions,
    allowing the double ctrl-C to work properly again. [related to GH-166]
  - Initial Vagrantfile is now heavily commented with various available
    options. [GH-171]
  - Box add checks if a box already exists before the download. [GH-170]
  - NFS no longer attempts to clean exports file if VM is not created,
    which was causing a stack trace during recovery. [related to GH-166]
  - Basic validation added for Chef configuration (both solo and server).
  - Top config class is now available in all `Vagrant::Config::Base`
    subclasses, which is useful for config validation.
  - Subcommand help shows proper full command in task listing. [GH-168]
  - SSH gives error message if `ssh` binary is not found. [GH-161]
  - SSH gives proper error message if VM is not running. [GH-167]
  - Fix some issues with undefined constants in command errors.

## 0.6.1, 0.6.2, 0.6.3 (September 27, 2010)

A lot of quick releases which all were to fix issues with Ruby 1.8.7
compatibility.

## 0.6.0 (September 27, 2010)

  - VM name now defaults to the name of the containing folder, plus a timestamp.
    This should make it easier to identify VMs in the VirtualBox GUI.
  - Exposed Vagrant test helpers in `Vagrant::TestHelpers` for plugins to easily
    test themselves against Vagrant environments.
  - **Plugins** have landed. Plugins are simply gems which have a `vagrant_init.rb`
    file somewhere in their load path. Please read the documentation on
    vagrantup.com before attempting to create a plugin (which is very easy)
    for more information on how it all works and also some guidelines.
  - `vagrant package` now takes a `--vagrantfile` option to specify a
    Vagrantfile to package. The `--include` approach for including a Vagrantfile
    no longer works (previously built boxes will continue to work).
  - `vagrant package` has new logic with regards to the `--include` option
    depending on if the file path is relative or absolute (they can be
    intermixed):
      * _Relative_ paths are copied directly into the box, preserving
        their path. So `--include lib/foo` would be in the box as "lib/foo"
      * _Absolute_ paths are simply copied files into the root of the
        box. So `--include /lib/foo` would be in the box as "foo"
  - "vagrant_main" is no longer the default run list. Instead, chef
    run list starts empty. It is up to you to specify all recipes in
    the Vagrantfile now.
  - Fixed various issues with certain action middleware not working if
    the VM was not created.
  - SSH connection is retried 5 times if there is a connection refused.
    Related to GH-140.
  - If `http_proxy` environmental variable is set, it will be used as the proxy
    box adding via http.
  - Remove `config.ssh.password`. It hasn't been used for a few versions
    now and was only kept around to avoid exceptions in Vagrantfiles.
  - Configuration is now validated so improper input can be found in
    Vagrantfiles.
  - Fixed issue with not detecting Vagrantfile at root directory ("/").
  - Vagrant now gives a nice error message if there is a syntax error
    in any Vagrantfile. [GH-154]
  - The format of the ".vagrant" file which stores persisted VMs has
    changed. This is **backwards incompatible**. Will provide an upgrade
    utility prior to 0.6 launch.
  - Every [expected] Vagrant error now exits with a clean error message
    and a unique exit status, and raises a unique exception (if you're
    scripting Vagrant).
  - Added I18n gem dependency for pulling strings into clean YML files.
    Vagrant is now localizable as a side effect! Translations welcome.
  - Fixed issue with "Waiting for cleanup" message appearing twice in
    some cases. [GH-145]
  - Converted CLI to use Thor. As a tradeoff, there are some backwards
    incompatibilities:
      * `vagrant package` - The `--include` flag now separates filenames
        by spaces, instead of by commas. e.g. `vagrant package --include x y z`
      * `vagrant ssh` - If you specify a command to execute using the `--execute`
        flag, you may now only specify one command (before you were able to
        specify an arbitrary amount). e.g. `vagrant ssh -e "echo hello"`
      * `vagrant ssh-config` has become `vagrant ssh_config` due to a limitation
        in Thor.

## 0.5.4 (September 7, 2010)

  - Fix issue with the "exec failed" by running on Tiger as well.
  - Give an error when downloading a box which already exists prior
    to actually downloading the box.

## 0.5.3 (August 23, 2010)

  - Add erubis as a dependency since its rendering of `erb` is sane.
  - Fixed poorly formatted Vagrantfile after `vagrant init`. [GH-142]
  - Fixed NFS not working properly with multiple NFS folders.
  - Fixed chef solo provision to work on Windows. It was expanding a linux
    path which prepended a drive letter onto it.

## 0.5.2 (August 3, 2010)

  - `vagrant up` can be used as a way to resume the VM as well (same as
    `vagrant resume`). [GH-134]
  - Sudo uses "-E" flag to preserve environment for chef provisioners.
    This fixes issues with CentOS. [GH-133]
  - Added "IdentitiesOnly yes" to options when `vagrant ssh` is run to
    avoid "Too Many Authentication Failures" error. [GH-131]
  - Fix regression with `package` not working. [GH-132]
  - Added ability to specify box url in `init`, which populates the
    Vagrantfile with the proper `config.vm.box_url`.

## 0.5.1 (July 31, 2010)

  - Allow specifying cookbook paths which exist only on the VM in `config.chef.cookbooks_path`.
    This is used for specifying cookbook paths when `config.chef.recipe_url` is used. [GH-130]
    See updated chef solo documentation for more information on this.
  - No longer show "Disabling host only networks..." if no host only networks
    are destroyed. Quiets `destroy`, `halt`, etc output a bit.
  - Updated getting started guide to be more up to date and generic. [GH-125]
  - Fixed error with doing a `vagrant up` when no Vagrantfile existed. [GH-128]
  - Fixed NFS erroring when NFS wasn't even enabled if `/etc/exports` doesn't
    exist. [GH-126]
  - Fixed `vagrant resume` to properly resume a suspended VM. [GH-122]
  - Fixed `halt`, `destroy`, `reload` to where they failed if the VM was
    in a saved state. [GH-123]
  - Added `config.chef.recipe_url` which allows you to specify a URL to
    a gzipped tar file for chef solo to download cookbooks. See the
    [chef-solo docs](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo#ChefSolo-RunningfromaURL) for more information.
    [GH-121]
  - Added `vagrant box repackage` which repackages boxes which have
    been added. This is useful in case you want to redistribute a base
    box you have but may have lost the actual "box" file. [GH-120]
