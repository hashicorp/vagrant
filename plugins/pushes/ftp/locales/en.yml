      missing_attribute: |-
        Missing required attribute '%{attribute}'. The Vagrant FTP Push plugin
        requires you set this attribute. Please set this attribute in your
        Vagrantfile, for example:

            config.push.define "ftp" do |push|
              push.%{attribute} = "..."
            end
      too_many_files: |-
        The configured directory for Vagrant FTP push contains too many files
        to successfully complete the command. This can be resolved by either
        removing extraneous files from the configured directory, or updating
        the `dir` configuration option to a subdirectory.
