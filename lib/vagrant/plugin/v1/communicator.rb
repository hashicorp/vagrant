      # Base class for a communicator in Vagrant. A communicator is
      # responsible for communicating with a machine in some way. There
      # are various stages of Vagrant that require things such as uploading
      # files to the machine, executing shell commands, etc. Implementors
      # of this class are expected to provide this functionality in some
      # way.
      #
      # Note that a communicator must provide **all** of the methods
      # in this base class. There is currently no way for one communicator
      # to provide say a more efficient way of uploading a file, but not
      # provide shell execution. This sort of thing will come in a future
      # version.

        # can be communicated with using this communicator. If this returns
        # `true`, then this class will be used as the primary communication
        # method for the machine.

        # expected to override this and do something with the machine if
        # you care about it.
