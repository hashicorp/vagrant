module Vagrant
  # Manages action running and registration. Every Vagrant environment
  # has an instance of {Action} to allow for running in the context of
  # the environment, which is accessible at {Environment#actions}. Actions
  # are the foundation of most functionality in Vagrant, and are implemented
  # architecturally as "middleware."
  #
  # # Registering an Action
  #
  # The main benefits of registering an action is the ability to retrieve and
  # modify that registered action, as well as easily run the action. An example
  # of registering an action is shown below, with a simple middleware which just
  # outputs to `STDOUT`:
  #
  #     class StdoutMiddleware
  #       def initialize(app, env)
  #         @app = app
  #       end
  #
  #       def call(env)
  #         puts "HI!"
  #         @app.call(env)
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     Vagrant::Action.register(:stdout, StdoutMiddleware)
  #
  # Then to run a registered action, assuming `env` is a loaded {Environment}:
  #
  #     env.actions.run(:stdout)
  #
  # Or to retrieve the action class for any reason:
  #
  #     Vagrant::Action[:stdout]
  #
  # # Running an Action
  #
  # There are various built-in registered actions such as `start`, `stop`, `up`,
  # etc. Actions are built to be run in the context of an environment, so use
  # {Environment#actions} to run all actions. Then simply call {#run}:
  #
  #     env.actions.run(:name)
  #
  # Where `:name` is the name of the registered action.
  #
