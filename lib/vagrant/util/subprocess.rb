      # installer), we want to reset to the "original" environment so that when
      # shelling out to other Ruby processes (specifically), the original
      # environment is restored. This is super important for things like
      # rbenv and chruby, who rely on environment variables to locate gems, but
      # Bundler stomps on those environment variables like an angry T-Rex after
      # watching Jurassic Park 2 and realizing they replaced you with CGI.

      # knows what the original environment was and replaces it completely.
