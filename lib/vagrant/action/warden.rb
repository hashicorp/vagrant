    # The action warden is a middleware which injects itself between

    # and performing proper cleanup on every action by calling the `recover`
    # method. The warden therefore allows middlewares to not worry about
    # exceptional events, and by providing a simple callback, can clean up
    # in any erroneous case.
    #
    # Warden will "just work" behind the scenes, and is not of particular
    # interest except to those who are curious about the internal workings
    # of Vagrant.
