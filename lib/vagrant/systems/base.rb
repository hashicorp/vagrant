  module Systems
    # The base class for a "system." A system represents an installed
    # operating system on a given box. There are some portions of
    # Vagrant which are fairly OS-specific (such as mounting shared
    # folders) and while the number is few, this abstraction allows
    # more obscure operating systems to be installed without having
    # to directly modify Vagrant internals.
    #
    # Subclasses of the system base class are expected to implement
    # all the methods. These methods are described in the comments
    # above their definition.
    #
    # **This is by no means a complete specification. The methods
    # required by systems can and will change at any time. Any
    # changes will be noted on release notes.**

      # returned, Vagrant will use it as the new system instance for the
