  # MachineIndex is able to manage the index of created Vagrant environments
  # in a central location.
  #
  # The MachineIndex stores a mapping of UUIDs to basic information about
  # a machine. The UUIDs are stored with the Vagrant environment and are
  # looked up in the machine index.
  #
  # The MachineIndex stores information such as the name of a machine,
  # the directory it was last seen at, its last known state, etc. Using
  # this information, we can load the entire {Machine} object for a machine,
  # or we can just display metadata if needed.
  #
  # The internal format of the data file is currently JSON in the following
  # structure:
  #
  #   {
  #     "version": 1,
  #     "machines": {
  #       "uuid": {
  #         "name": "foo",
  #         "provider": "vmware_fusion",
  #         "data_path": "/path/to/data/dir",
  #         "vagrantfile_path": "/path/to/Vagrantfile",
  #         "state": "running",
  #         "updated_at": "2014-03-02 11:11:44 +0100"
