# Contribute to Vagrant: Documentation

One of the biggest reasons for Vagrant's success has been decent
documentation. The website has an easy getting started guide, in depth
documentation for those who want it, and an in depth contribution guide
here for people like you! But it's difficult to cover 100% of a project
in documentation, and sometimes documentation does get out of date. For
the developers behind Vagrant, it is often difficult to keep up with
features added and removed, specific notes for certain Vagrant use cases,
etc.

If you find a part of the documentation that could use updating,
wish to add a completely new page, tweak some styling, or even completely
redesign the website, then you can contribute this to Vagrant!

Updating the website is extremely simple. In fact, all of the website
content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax),
so you don't even need any HTML or design chops to update it!

The sidebar to the left contains links to get you started in working with
the website. If you're new to the whole process, we recommend reading the
pages in order, as it will cover the full spectrum of updating, running,
and contributing to the documentation.
