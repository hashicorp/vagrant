# Puppet Provisioning

[Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet) allows you to provision your virtual machines with Puppet manifests.  It
runs in a stand-alone mode that doesn't require a Puppet server.

This page will not go into the details of creating Puppet manifests, since that
is covered in detail around the web, but a good place to start is the [Puppet Labs Docs site](http://docs.puppetlabs.com).

## Setting the Manifests Path

First, Vagrant needs to know where the Puppet manifests are located. By default, Vagrant will
look in the `manifests` directory relative to the root of the project directory (where
the project's Vagrantfile is located). The `manifests` should contain a file for each box to be configured,
the default assumes a file named after the value of config.vm.box option:

Both the file and path can be configured using the `manifest_file` and `manifests_path` options in your
Vagrantfile configuration file, for example:

{% highlight ruby %}
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.puppet.manifests_path = "puppetmanifests"
  config.puppet.manifest_file = "newbox.pp"
end
{% endhighlight %}

## Configuring the manifests

Creating a basic manifest is simple, for example:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Basic Puppet manifests

class lucid32 {
  package { "apache2":
    ensure => present,
  }

  service { "apache2":
    ensure => running,
    require => Package["apache2"],
  }
}

include lucid32
{% endhighlight %}

## Configuring the Puppet provisioning path

In order to run Puppet, Vagrant has to mount the specified manifests directory as a
shared folder on the virtual machine. By default, this is set to be `/tmp/vagrant-puppet`,
and this should be fine for most users. But in the case that you need to customize
the location, you can do so in the Vagrantfile:

{% highlight ruby %}
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.puppet.pp_path = "/tmp/vagrant-puppet"
end
{% endhighlight %}

This folder is created for provisioning purposes and destroyed once provisioning
is complete.

# Setting options

You can also specify additional options to be passed to Puppet using the `options` variable.

{% highlight ruby %}
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.puppet.options = ["--modulepath","modules"]
end
{% endhighlight %} 
 
You can also pass options as strings:

{% highlight ruby %}
  config.puppet.options = "--verbose --debug"
{% endhighlight %} 

## Enabling and Executing

Finally, once everything is setup, provisioning can be enabled and run. To enable
provisioning, tell Vagrant to use Puppet in the Vagrantfile:

{% highlight ruby %}
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.provisioner = :puppet
end
{% endhighlight %}

Once enabled, if you are building a VM from scratch, run `vagrant up` and provisioning
will automatically occur. If you already have a running VM and don't want to rebuild
everything from scratch, run `vagrant reload` and it will restart the VM, without completely
destroying the environment first, allowing the import step to be skipped.
