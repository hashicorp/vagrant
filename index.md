Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing virtualized development environments.

By providing automated creation and provisioning of virtual machines
using [Oracle's VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org), Vagrant provides
the tools to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable
virtual environments. For more information, see the part of the
getting started guide on "[Why Vagrant?](/docs/getting-started/why.html)"

Are you ready to revolutionize the way you work? Check out
the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/index.html), the
[getting started video](http://vimeo.com/9976342).

## Your First Vagrant Virtual Environment

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install vagrant
$ vagrant box add base http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box
$ vagrant init
$ vagrant up
{% endhighlight %}

These four commands alone will automatically download and create a bare bones
Ubuntu-based server running in the background. Sure, that on its own isn't
that amazing, but imagine running a single `vagrant up` and having a fully
featured web development environment running! This is all possible with Vagrant.
